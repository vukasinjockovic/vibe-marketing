## 1. SECTION OVERVIEW & CORE ARCHITECTURE

### The Enhancement Stack

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]
The five enhancement forces applied to a core offer, in this order:
1. **Scarcity** - decrease supply to raise prices (and indirectly increase demand through perceived exclusiveness)
2. **Urgency** - increase demand by decreasing the action threshold of a prospect
3. **Bonuses** - increase demand (and increase perceived exclusivity)
4. **Guarantees** - increase demand by reversing risk
5. **Naming** - re-stimulate demand and expand awareness of the offer to the target audience

> "The products remained unchanged, yet within this setting, an item that wouldn't sell at a different venue for $10,000 sold for $100,000. That's how powerful scarcity, urgency, and bonuses are." -- Chapter 11

### The Supply-Demand Master Principle

[PRINCIPLE] [Layer 0-foundational]

> "Fundamentally, all marketing exists to influence the supply and demand curve. We artificially increase the demand for our products and services through some sort of persuasive communication. When we increase the demand, we can sell more units. When we decrease supply, we can sell those units for more money. The 'perfect profit combination' is lots of demand, and very little supply, or perceived supply." -- Chapter 11

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]

> "Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want." -- Naval Ravikant, quoted in Chapter 11

> "We only want things we do not have. As soon as we have them, our desire for them disappears. Therefore, if we seek to increase the demand (or desire), we must decrease or delay satisfying the desires of our prospects. We must sell fewer units than we otherwise can." -- Chapter 11

### Hormozi Law

[PRINCIPLE] [Layer 0-foundational]

> "The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make. 'The longer the runway, the bigger the plane that can take off.'" -- Chapter 11

### The Fractal Demand Principle

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]

> "In my experience, demand for services is non-linear. Instead, I've found demand to be fractal (80/20). In other words, one fifth of the prospects are willing to pay five times the price (or more)." -- Chapter 11

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 2-strategic]
**IF** you have 10 prospects willing to pay $500 **THEN** approximately 2 of them are willing to pay $5,000. Skim the top of the pyramid with fewer, higher-priced slots.

### The Pent-Up Demand Flywheel

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]

> "If we were to promote scenario one again (the $500 price point), we would probably sell fewer slots the second time around. Why? We have no pent up demand. All desire has been satisfied. When you 'pull the trigger too early,' each successive instance we promote, we sell even fewer. Eventually, we run out of sufficient demand to make even a single sale." -- Chapter 11

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 2-strategic]
IF you satisfy ALL demand in one launch THEN you kill future demand.
IF you leave some demand unsatisfied THEN those prospects come back with more urgency and willingness to pay more next time.

> "We must endeavor to keep our supply (and satisfaction of desire) under the demand that we are able to generate. This maximizes profits and keeps desire ravenous in our customer base." -- Chapter 11

---

## 2. SCARCITY (Chapter 12)

### Core Definition

[PRINCIPLE] [Layer 0-foundational]

> "When there's a fixed supply or quantity of products or services that are available for purchase it creates 'scarcity' or a 'fear of missing out.' It increases the need to take action, and by extension, purchase your offer." -- Chapter 12

> "Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain. We will wield this psychological lever to get your clients to buy in a frenzy, all at once, until you are sold out." -- Chapter 12

### The Three Types of Scarcity

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]

1. **Limited Supply of Seats/Slots** - in general or over X period of time
2. **Limited Supply of Bonuses**
3. **Never available again**

### Scarcity for Physical Products

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF selling physical products THEN use limited releases (flavors, colors, designs, sizes).

> "This month, we are releasing 100 boxes of mint chocolate cookie flavored protein bars." -- Chapter 12

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF using limited releases THEN always sell out. It is better to sell out consistently than over-order and fail at creating scarcity.

> "Important point: to properly utilize this method you should always sell out." -- Chapter 12

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF you sold out THEN you MUST let everyone know you sold out. This is part of what makes it work.

> "When using this tactic, you must also let everyone know that you sold out. That is part of what makes it work so well. This way, even people who were on the fence, when they see that it was sold out, it gives social proof that other people thought it was worth it. And now that the choice has been made for them, they desire it more because there is no way they can get it." -- Chapter 12

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF doing limited releases THEN cadence of once a month is the sweet spot.

> "This method stacks in effectiveness if it is done repeatedly over time (just not too often). Once a month seems to be the sweet spot for most of the companies that I know who do this with regularity." -- Chapter 12

### Scarcity for Services (4 Methods)

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

**Method 1: Total Business Cap**
"Only accepting X Clients. Only accepting X clients at this level of service (on-going)."

> "This puts a cap on how many clients you service but also keeps them in it. You create a waiting list for new prospects. The moment the door opens, they jump right in and price resistance disappears. Periodically, you can increase capacity by 10-20% then cap it again. This works well for your highest tiers or service levels." -- Chapter 12

Template: "My agency only will service twenty-five customers total. Period."

**Method 2: Growth Rate Cap**
"Only accepting X clients per week (on-going)"

Template:
> "We only accept 5 new clients per week and we already have the first 3 spots taken. I have 6 more calls this week, so you can take the spot or one of my next calls and you can wait until we reopen." -- Chapter 12

**Method 3: Cohort Cap**
"Only accepting X clients per class or cohort."

Template:
> "We take on 100 clients 4 times a year. We open the doors then close them." -- Chapter 12

**Method 4: Total Business Cap with No-Return Policy**

> "You can create scarcity by also capping your service level and saying that if they leave they can never return. This type of scarcity makes people think extra hard about leaving." -- Chapter 12

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF using no-return scarcity THEN use only with small groups. "As groups become much bigger, the tactic loses some teeth."

### Honest Scarcity (The Most Ethical Scarcity)

[PRINCIPLE] [Layer 2-strategic]

> "The easiest scarcity strategy is honesty." -- Chapter 12

> "Simply letting people know that you are three-fourths of the way to capacity this week will move people over the edge to buying from you. Or letting people know that you are 81% to capacity in your total business, will make people more likely to sign up with you 'before they lose the chance.'" -- Chapter 12

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]

> "Scarcity also implies within it, social proof. If you are 81% to capacity then a decent amount of people made the decision to work with you, and the closer you get to your arbitrary fullness, the faster the spots will disappear. But only you get to draw where that line is 'full.'" -- Chapter 12

### Extreme Scarcity Pro Tip

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF you want to immediately make a lot of money THEN create a very exclusive service level based on access to you (yes, unscalable), cap it at a tiny number, price it very high, then tell people.

> "If you don't hate money, sell a very limited supply of 1-on-1 access. You can do that via any of the mediums described in 'Delivery Cube.' Direct message access. Email Access. Phone access. Voice memo access. Zoom access." -- Chapter 12

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF creating higher-ticket upsells (workshops, trainings, events, consulting) THEN pair with clear scarcity or fixed amounts/seats/spots.

> "Always remember have less spots available than you think you can sell . . . so that when you want to do it again in the future, everyone will remember you sold out . . . fast. This is a compounding strategy that increases in effectiveness over time. One of the few in the marketing arsenal." -- Chapter 12

### Scarcity on Free Lead Magnets

[EXAMPLE] [Layer 4-specific]

> "If I told you I have it set so that every week the page only allows twenty new people to download it, you'd be far more likely to go see if you can grab it. And even more so if when you try it, you see that it has already run out for the week. Result? You join a list that notifies you the next time twenty more checklists become available for download." -- Chapter 12

> "By employing scarcity, we make what would otherwise be a 'neat free download' into a desirable thing not everyone has access to. You also, by extension, would be far more likely to consume it when you do get your hands on it." -- Chapter 12

---

## 3. URGENCY (Chapter 13)

### Core Definition

[PRINCIPLE] [Layer 0-foundational]

> "Scarcity is a function of quantity. Urgency is a function of time." -- Chapter 13

> "This is where you only limit when people can sign up, rather than how many." -- Chapter 13

### The Four Types of Urgency

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]

1. Rolling Cohorts
2. Rolling Seasonal Urgency
3. Promotional or Pricing Urgency
4. Exploding Opportunity

### Type 1: Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

Template (basic):
> "If you sign up today, I can get you in with our next group that kicks off on Monday, otherwise you'll have to wait until our next kickoff date." -- Chapter 13

Template (juiced up):
> "I actually had a client who signed up a few weeks ago drop out, so I have an opening for our next cohort that kicks off on Monday. If you are pretty sure you're gonna do this sooner or later, might as well get in on it now so you can start reaping the rewards sooner rather than paying the same and waiting." -- Chapter 13

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF you start clients on a regular cadence (weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly) THEN use that cadence as a natural urgency lever.

> "Obviously the less frequently you kick off new customers, the more powerful this is." -- Chapter 13

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF someone wants to buy but you just started a cohort THEN either:
Option A: "Offer them a speedy personalized onboarding to get them up to speed as a 'bonus' for signing up today"
Option B: "Explain to them that since the next group starts in a little, they will have the advantage of having more time to review the materials...On top of that, they can have a more extended payment plan that you can only make available to them since the start date is so far out...an advantage that most clients do not get."

### Type 2: Rolling Seasonal Urgency

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

> "In a digital setting, having actual sign up date countdowns is very useful. But make sure they are real. If they aren't, you'll lose credibility and just look like every other wannabe marketer." -- Chapter 13

Template examples:
> "Our New Year Promotion ends Jan 30!"
> "Our Valentines Lovers Promo Ends Feb 30!"
> "Our Sexy By Spring Special Ends March 31!"
> "Our Fools in Love April Promo Ends April 30!" -- Chapter 13

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]

> "The actual promotion may be the same, but naming it something different 'by season' gives you a 'real' differentiator that gives you a start and a finish. Deadlines drive decisions." -- Chapter 13

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF local business THEN this is the #1 strategy. "They must vary their marketing more frequently than national advertisers. Putting a new wrapper with a date on the same core service gives you urgency and novelty that will consistently outperform the 'same old' campaigns."

### Type 3: Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

Template:
> "Yes, let's get you started today so you can take advantage of the discount you came in for. I'm not sure how long we will be running it as we change them every 4 weeks or so, and this is one of the better ones we have run in a while." -- Chapter 13

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]
This creates fear of missing out on the PROMOTION (not the service itself). The urgency is on the deal, not the availability.

> "You can interchange a pricing promotion, discount, or added bonuses like free install or free onboarding or an extra workshop (valued at $1,000) if they buy now. These are all things you can swap around your core offer to create urgency." -- Chapter 13

### Type 4: Exploding Opportunity

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]
Used when exposing the prospect to an arbitrage opportunity that decays with time.

> "Every second someone delays, they miss out on disproportionate gains." -- Chapter 13

Examples: platform arbitrage, market inefficiencies, early-mover advantages, competitive job offers.

> "Highly competitive job environments often get job offers that are 'exploding offers' everyday they wait to take the job, their pay or bonuses decrease." -- Chapter 13

### Urgency: The Last-Day Phenomenon

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]

> "The biggest sales on a week long campaign or launch happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (up to 50-60%). That means that the last 3% of the time allotted creates 50-60% of the sales...that's completely illogical, but also unmistakably human." -- Chapter 13

### Price Change Pipeline Cleaning

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF you are raising your prices THEN always let people know before raising. "Never raise your prices without letting people know. It shows a position of strength and will give you a nice little influx of cash from the people in the pipeline who were on the fence."

---

## 4. BONUSES (Chapter 14)

### Core Principle

[PRINCIPLE] [Layer 0-foundational]

> "A single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses." -- Chapter 14

> "The reason this works is we are increasing the prospect's price-to-value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered instead of cutting the price. We anchor the price we tell them to the core offer. Then with each increasingly valuable bonus, that discrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket." -- Chapter 14

### Bonuses vs Discounting

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 2-strategic]

> "Whenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices. It puts you in a position of strength and goodwill rather than weakness." -- Chapter 14 Pro Tip

### Presenting Bonuses: 1-on-1 vs Group Selling

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF selling one-on-one THEN ask for the sale FIRST, before offering bonuses.
- IF they say YES THEN reveal bonuses after signup to create a wow experience and reinforce their decision.
- IF they say NO THEN present a bonus that matches their perceived obstacle, then ask again.

> "Don't feel weird about asking again. You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and ask if this consolation was 'Fair enough.' People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another, then another, and people will feel almost obligated to buy from you." -- Chapter 14

### The 11 Bonus Bullets (Complete Bonus Presentation Framework)

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]

1. Always offer them (use the bulleted bundle from Trim & Stack)
2. Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title
3. Tell them:
   a) How it relates to their issue
   b) What it is
   c) How you discovered it, or what you had to do to create it
   d) How it will specifically improve their lives or make their experience:
      i) Faster, easier or less effort/sacrifice (value equation)
4. Provide some proof (stat, past client, or personal experience) to prove this thing is valuable
5. Paint a vivid mental image of what their life will be like assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the benefits
6. Always ascribe a price tag to them and justify it
7. Tools & checklists are better than additional trainings (as the effort & time are lower with the former, so the value is higher. The value equation still reigns supreme)
8. They should each address a specific concern/obstacle in the prospect's mind about why they can't or won't be successful (bonus should prove their belief incorrect)
9. This can also be what they would logically realize they will need next. You want to solve their next problem before they even encounter it.
10. The value of the bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. "Psychologically as you continue to add offers, it continues to expand the price to value discrepancy. It also, subconsciously communicates that the core offer must be valuable because if these are the bonuses, the main thing has to be more valuable than the bonuses right? (No, but you can use this psychological bias to make your offer seem wildly compelling)."
11. You can further enhance the value of your bonuses by adding scarcity and urgency to the bonuses themselves.

### Bonuses With Scarcity (Templates)

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

Version 1: "Only people who sign up for XYZ program will have access to my Bonus #1, 2, 3 that are never for sale or available anywhere else other than through this program."

Version 2: "I have 3 tickets left to my $5,000 virtual event, if you buy this program you can get one of the last 3 tickets as a bonus."

### Bonuses With Urgency (Template)

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

Version 1: "If you buy today, I will add in XYZ bonus that normally costs $1,000, for free. And I'll do that because I want to reward action takers."

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]
The scarcity versions are NOT constrained by time -- they state that buying the program unlocks things you otherwise cannot get. The urgency version is about buying TODAY, and losing those bonuses if they do not.

### Advanced Level Bonuses: Other People's Products and Services

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

> "You can get other businesses to give you their services and products as a part of your bonuses in exchange for exposure to your clients for free. This is free marketing for them, and high value products for you at no cost." -- Chapter 14

[EXAMPLE] [Layer 4-specific]
Pain clinic example:
- Chiropractor: 2 free adjustments (Value: $100)
- Low inflammation food company: discounts ($50 savings)
- Braces and orthotics discounts ($150 savings)
- Local health club: free personal training + month of membership ($100 value)
- Pharmacy drug discounts ($100/mo savings)
- Stack multiples of the same provider (10 chiropractors = 10 free adjustments)

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF you secure enough partner bonuses THEN you can justify your entire price in the savings and additional true-to-price bonuses.

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF using partner bonuses THEN also negotiate: (a) a group discount for your customers and (b) a referral commission to yourself. Your bonuses become revenue streams.

### What Should Be a Bonus vs Core Offer?

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]

> "Short answer: Wow Factor - in other words - something you wouldn't want someone to miss. Many times you have so much 'stuff' you will be providing your customers (good thing) that valuable nuggets can get lost in the mix. You want to take the most distinct ones that can almost stand on their own and pull those out to highlight them." -- Chapter 14

> "This is especially true for things that are short in length but high in quality or value. Checklists or infographics can condense a lot of information into a small space. Someone might not feel justified paying lots of money for a product launch map (for example) but as a bonus would be perceived as very valuable." -- Chapter 14

### Ideal Bonus Types

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

> "Create checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates, and anything else that would take lots of time and effort to create on one's own, but is easy to use once created. Anything that you can invest in one time that clearly cost time or money to create, but can be given away endless time is a perfect fit for a bonus." -- Chapter 14

Additional bonus assets:
- Recorded workshops, webinars, events, interviews
- Information products (high perceived value, low cost, zero operational effort)
- Tickets to virtual experiences or events
- Higher level of service for a trial period (also doubles as upsell mechanism)

---

## 5. GUARANTEES (Chapter 15)

### Core Principle

[PRINCIPLE] [Layer 0-foundational]

> "The single greatest objection for any product or service being sold is...drum roll...risk. Risk that it doesn't do what it's supposed to do for them." -- Chapter 15

> "Reversing risk is the number one way to increase the conversion of an offer. Experienced marketers spend as much time crafting their guarantees as the deliverables themselves." -- Chapter 15

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]
Jason Fladlien: "he had seen the conversion on an offer 2-4x simply by changing the quality of the guarantee." -- Chapter 15

### The Four Types of Guarantees

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]

1. **Unconditional**
2. **Conditional**
3. **Anti-Guarantee**
4. **Implied Guarantees**

> "You must always hit your guarantee hard, even if you don't have one. Say it boldly and give the reason why." -- Chapter 15

### The Guarantee Power Formula

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]

> "What makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z." -- Chapter 15

> "Without the 'or what' portion of the guarantee, it sounds weak and diluted." -- Chapter 15

Bad Example: "We will get you 20 clients guaranteed."
Better Example: "You will get 20 clients in your first 30 days, or we give you your money back + your advertising dollars spent with us."

### The Math of Guarantees

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]

> "If you close 130 percent as many people, and your refund percentage doubles from 5 percent to 10 percent, you've still made 1.23x the money, or 23 percent more, and that all goes to the bottom line." -- Chapter 15

Exact math:
```
Without guarantee: 100 sales, 5 refunds (5%) = 95 Net Sales
With guarantee:    130 sales, 13 refunds (10%) = 117 Net Sales
117/95 = 1.23x (23% increase)
```

> "For a guarantee to not be worth it, the increase in sales would have to be 100 percent offset by people who refunded." -- Chapter 15

### Type 1: Unconditional Guarantees

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

What the client gets (options):
A) A full refund
B) A 50 percent refund
C) A refund of their ad spend and any ancillary costs incurred
D) You pay for a competitor's program instead
E) You return their money plus an additional $1,000 (or other applicable amount)

#### Jason Fladlien's Unconditional Guarantee Script (Verbatim)

[FORMULA] [Layer 4-specific]

> "I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision, that is all. The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside. So you get on the inside and see if everything we say on this webinar is true and valuable to you. Then, if it is, that's when you decide to keep it. If it's not for you, no hard feelings. You will then, after signing up at URL be able to make a fully informed decision that this isn't for you. But you can't make this decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it. And know this...whether it's 29 min or 29 days from now...if you ain't happy, I ain't happy. For any reason whatsoever, if you want your money back you can get it because I only want to keep your money if you're happy. All you have to do is go to support@xyz.com and tell use 'gimme my money' and you got it, and in short order - our response times to any support request average 61min over a 24/7 time period. You can only make such a guarantee when you're confident that what you have is the real deal and I'm fairly confident that when you sign up at URL you're getting exactly what you need to BENEFIT." -- Jason Fladlien, quoted in Chapter 15

#### Satisfaction-Based Guarantee Script (Hormozi's Own)

[FORMULA] [Layer 4-specific]

> "Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm not guaranteeing you're going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500 worth of value and service from us to support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I'll write you a check the day you tell me we suck." -- Chapter 15

Best-case/worst-case close:
> "Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed not to help you is walking out of here today." -- Chapter 15

Result: "I had two people take me up on it out of 4,000 sales in three and a half years."

### Type 2: Conditional Guarantees

[PRINCIPLE] [Layer 2-strategic]

> "In general, you want these to be 'better than money back' guarantees. Because if they are going to make an investment, you want to match their investment psychologically with an equal or higher perceived commitment." -- Chapter 15

> "In a perfect world, 100% of your customers would qualify for a conditional guarantee, but will have achieved their result, and therefore will not want to take it." -- Chapter 15

#### Conditional Guarantee Subtypes (Complete List)

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

**a) Outsized Refund Guarantee**
What client gets: Double or triple their money back, or a no-strings-attached payment far more than what they paid.
When to use: High margin products. Pair with consumption conditions.

[EXAMPLE] [Layer 4-specific]
> Jason Fladlien "said 'if you buy this course and spend $X on advertising your ecommerce store using the methods herein, and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for $25,000 no questions asked.' He claimed that an additional $3M in sales came from this crazy guarantee on a $2997 course. What's more, he only gave 10 of these $25,000 refunds out. So the refund generated $2.75M in extra sales." -- Chapter 15

**b) Service Guarantee**
What client gets: You keep working for them free of charge until X is achieved.

> "This is probably my personal favorite guarantee of all time. It essentially guarantees they will achieve their goal, but it eliminates the element of time. You are never at risk for losing the money." -- Chapter 15

> "Since I have been advising businesses to use this particular guarantee, I have yet to have a single person say a client took them up on it." -- Chapter 15

**c) Modified Service Guarantee**
What client gets: Another Y-long period of service or access free of charge (typically 2x the original duration).

**d) Credit-Based Guarantee**
What client gets: Their payment back as a credit toward any service you offer.
When to use: During an upsell process.

**e) Personal Service Guarantee**
What client gets: You work with them one-on-one, free of charge, until they reach X objective.

> "This is absolutely one of the strongest guarantees in existence. It's like a service guarantee on crack." -- Chapter 15

Template: "Alex will personally work with you until your offer converts."
Conditions to add: "Provided you've already spent $10,000 on your existing offer using our structure, the offer you ran was for lead generation, and it was a free offer."

**f) Hotel + Airfare Perks Guarantee**
What client gets: Reimbursement of product cost PLUS hotel + airfare if they don't receive value.
When to use: Workshops, in-person experiences.

**g) Wage-Payment Guarantee**
What client gets: You offer to pay their hourly rate if they don't find the session valuable.
Note: "If someone ever actually asks for the wage payment, just ask them for their tax return and divide it by 1,960."

**h) Release of Service Guarantee**
What client gets: You let them out of their contract free of charge.
When to use: Businesses with enforceable commitments, contracts, or clauses.

**i) Delayed Second Payment Guarantee**
What client gets: No billing again until after they make or get their first outcome (lose first 5 lbs, make first sale, get website live, etc.).

> "It gets the prospect thinking in fast action terms and gets them moving. It will also focus your team on activating your client." -- Chapter 15

**j) First Outcome Guarantee**
What client gets: You continue to pay their ancillary costs (ad spend, hotel, etc.) until they reach their first outcome.
Template: "If you don't make your first sale in 14 days, we will pay for your ad spend until you do."

### Type 3: Anti-Guarantees

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

> "Anti-guarantees are when you explicitly state 'all sales are final.' You will want to own this position. You must come up with a creative 'reason why' the sales are final." -- Chapter 15

Template 1 (exposure-based):
> "We are going to show you our proprietary process that we are using right now to generate leads in our business. Our funnels, ads, and metrics. We're going to be exposing the inner workings of our business, as a result, all sales are final." -- Chapter 15

Template 2 (screening-based):
> "If you're the type of customer who needs a guarantee before taking a jump, then you are not the type of person we want to work with. We want motivated self-starters who can follow instructions and are not looking for a way out before they even begin. If you are not serious, don't buy it. But if you are, boy are you going to make a killing." -- Chapter 15

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF using anti-guarantee THEN you MUST provide a strong "reason why" -- show real exposure/vulnerability.

> "Since it is so standard to have some sort of guarantee, not having one is attention-worthy." -- Chapter 15

### Type 4: Implied Guarantees (Performance Models)

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

Structures:
- Performance: Only pay $XXX per sale / $XXX per show / $XX per Lb Lost
- Revshare: 10% of top line revenue / 20% profit share / 25% of revenue growth from baseline
- Profit-Share: X% of profit / X% of Gross Profit
- Ratchets: 10% if over X, 20% if over Y, 30% if over Z
- Bonuses/Triggers: I get X when Y occurs

> "Performance, Revshare, and Profit-shares aren't guarantees 'per se', but for all intents and purposes, they are. There is an implied guarantee whenever you enter into a revshare or performance partnership: if you dont make money, you don't have to pay me." -- Chapter 15

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF using performance/revshare THEN pair with a minimum. "It would be like saying 'we get the greater of $1000 or 10% of revenue generated.'"

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF setup takes a long time to get going THEN use hybrid: "$1000/mo for the first 3 months, then after that, it switches to 100% performance."

### Stacking Guarantees

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]

> "Like bonuses, you can actually stack guarantees." -- Chapter 15

Stack Pattern 1: Unconditional + Conditional
"Give an unconditional 30 day no questions asked guarantee then on top of that give a conditional triple your money back 90 day guarantee."

Stack Pattern 2: Conditional + Conditional (Sequential Outcomes)
"You'll make $10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days as long as you do thing 1, 2, and 3."

> "This future paces the prospect into an outcome they now believe is far more likely (since you will be deliberately spelling it out in a conditional guarantee with a timeline for achievement)." -- Chapter 15

### Guarantee Naming

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF giving a guarantee THEN name it something creative, not generic.

Bad: "30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee"

Good: "In 30 days, if you wouldn't jump into shark infested waters to get our product back, we will return every dollar you paid."

Great: "You'll get our famous 'Club a Baby Seal Guarantee' -- After 30 days of using our services, if you wouldn't club a baby seal to stay on as a customer, you don't have to pay a penny."

### Guarantee Selection Decision Rules

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 2-strategic]
IF lower ticket B2C THEN use bigger, broader unconditional guarantees ("many people just won't bother taking the time" to refund).
IF higher ticket and/or B2B THEN steer towards specific conditional guarantees (may or may not include refunds).

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 2-strategic]
IF tremendous cost associated with product/service THEN use conditional guarantee or anti-guarantee, "as you will have to eat the cost of the refund AND the cost of fulfilling."

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 2-strategic]
IF starting out THEN use service-based guarantees or performance partnerships first. "This will make all sales final (so no fear from refunds). Most importantly, it will commit you to your customers' results." Then move up to less restrictive guarantees to increase volume.

### Create Your Own Guarantee (Process)

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]

> "The key is to identify a client's biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles. 'What do they not want to have happen if they pay you? What are they most afraid of?' Reverse their fears into a guarantee. Think of the time, emotion, and outside costs associated with any program or service. The more specific and creative the guarantee is, the better." -- Chapter 15

---

## 6. NAMING (Chapter 16)

### Core Principle

[PRINCIPLE] [Layer 0-foundational]

> "Like the tree that falls in the forest that no one hears, having a Grand Slam Offer will not make you money if no one finds out about it." -- Chapter 16

> "Half-ass naming your product or offering can ruin conversions. Don't fall victim to lazy naming. Follow the steps here to name your product or service offering and watch the same offer get 2x, 3x, or 10x the response rate." -- Chapter 16

### The M-A-G-I-C Naming Formula

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]

Components (each roughly translates to a marketing concept):
- **M** = Make a Magnetic "Reason Why" (Attention)
- **A** = Announce Your Avatar (Discrimination)
- **G** = Give Them a Goal (Purpose)
- **I** = Indicate a Time Interval (Timeline)
- **C** = Complete With a Container Word (Method)

> "Not all these components are mandatory. You will typically use three to five of them in naming a program or service. If you can fit them all in, great, but it's likely the name will become too long." -- Chapter 16

> "The shorter and punchier the better. So it's a balance between brevity and specificity." -- Chapter 16

> "You don't need to do them in the M-A-G-I-C order. Do what sounds punchier to you." -- Chapter 16

### M - Make a Magnetic "Reason Why"

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

The "reason why" answers: Why are they making this great offer? OR Why should I respond / What's in it for me?

> "I like to tell people to think like a fraternity party planner. When I was in college, we had a party once because a guy got his wisdom teeth removed. I say this to say...the 'reason why' can literally be anything." -- Chapter 16

Examples: Free, 88% off, Giveaway, Spring, Summer, Back To School, Grand Opening, New Management, New Building, Anniversary, Halloween, New Year.

### A - Announce Your Avatar

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

Call out your ideal avatar: who you are looking for and who you are NOT looking for.

> "You want to be as specific as possible, but no more. When in a local area, the more local you can make your headline, the more it will convert. So don't do a city, try and go to the sub market, or hyper local area. Not Baltimore but Towson, MD. Not Chicago, but Hinsdale." -- Chapter 16

Examples: Bee Cave Dentists, Rolling Hills Moms, Brick & Mortar Businesses, Salon Owners, Retired Athletes, Brooklyn Busy Executives

### G - Give Them A Goal

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

Articulate the prospect's dream outcome. Can be a single word or phrase. Can be an event, feeling, experience, or outcome.

> "The more specific and tangible, the better." -- Chapter 16

Examples: Pain Free, Celebrity Smile, 1st Place, Never Out Of Breath, Perfect Product, Grand Slam Offer, Little Black Dress, Double Your Profit, First Client, High Ticket, 7 Figure, 100k

### I - Indicate a Time Interval

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

Let people know the duration to expect.

> "If you're making any sort of quantifiable claim (like income gain or weight loss) most platforms will not approve this type of messaging with a stated duration to achievement because it implies a guarantee." -- Chapter 16

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF the goal is a quantifiable claim THEN do NOT pair it with a time interval (platform compliance issues). Use a non-claim goal instead.
"$10,000 in 10 days" (bad -- implies guarantee) vs "Make Your First Sale in 10 Days" (better)

Examples: AA Minutes, BB Hours, CC Days, DD Weeks, Z Months. "4 Hour" "21 Day" "6 Week" "3 Month"

### C - Complete With A Container Word

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

> "The container word denotes that this offer is a bundle of lots of things put together. It's a system. It's something that can't be held up to a commoditized alternative." -- Chapter 16

Examples: Challenge, Blueprint, Bootcamp, Intensive, Incubator, Masterclass, Program, Detox, Experience, Summit, Accelerator, Fast Track, Shortcut, Sprint, Launch, Slingshot, Catapult, Explosion, System, Getaway, Meetup, Transformation, Mastermind, Launch, Game Plan, Deep Dive, Workshop, Comeback, Rebirth, Attack, Assault, Reset, Solution, Hack, Cheatcode, Liftoff

### Naming Enhancement: Rhyming

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

> "Good rhymes stick in people's minds. Rhyme your program name to win the game." -- Chapter 16

> "Don't try and force it. It's not a requirement, it's just a 'nice-to-have'." -- Chapter 16

Examples: Six-Pack Fast Track, 5-Day Book Print Sprint, Marriage Thrive Deep Dive, 12-Week 2-Putt Shortcut, 12-Month No-Debt Reset, Celebrity Butt Shortcut

### Naming Enhancement: Alliteration

[FORMULA] [Layer 3-tactical]

> "Alliteration is when you make all (or most) of the words start with the same letter or sound." -- Chapter 16

Examples: Make Money Masterclass, Change Your Life Challenge, Big Booty Bootcamp, Debt Detox, Real Estate Reset, Life Coach Liftoff

### Sub-Item & Bonus Naming

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]

> "Use the magic headline formula for each item in your stack and bundle. It will automatically enhance the value of your offerings simply by naming in a way that resonates with your prospects." -- Chapter 16

---

## 7. OFFER FATIGUE & VARIATION FRAMEWORK

### When Offers Fatigue

[MECHANISM] [Layer 1-theoretical]

> "Over time, offers fatigue. And in local markets, they fatigue even faster. Why? In a local market, it costs relatively little to reach an entire population." -- Chapter 16

> "Reaching an audience one time in no way means an offer is fatigued. Most people don't even notice an offer on the first mention. That's why you need to create new creative (videos, images) and new hooks, stories, and copy around the same offers. You can still use offers for a long time. But when we're talking about years of use, not months, offers can eventually fatigue." -- Chapter 16

### The Variation Hierarchy (Ordered by Operational Weight)

[FORMULA] [Layer 2-strategic]

Change these in order, from lightest to heaviest:
1. Change the creative (images and pictures in your ads)
2. Change the body copy in your ads
3. Change the headline -- the "wrapper" of your offer
   - "Free 6 Week Lean Challenge" to "Free 6 Week Tone Challenge"
   - "Holiday Hangover" to "New Year New You"
4. Change the duration of your offer
5. Change the enhancer of your offer (your free/discount component)
6. Change the monetization structure, the series of offers you give prospects, and the price points

> "I follow this variation framework because most of the time it's the first handful of items that need to be changed. Typically, they need to be changed again and again without touching anything on the bottom of the list." -- Chapter 16

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 2-strategic]
IF ads fatigue THEN do NOT change your entire business. Just run the same ad with a different video or image. Only go deeper in the hierarchy when the lighter changes stop working.

> "Once you've monetized an offer, rarely should you change it. Just rinse and repeat over and over and over again." -- Chapter 16

> "So use your entrepreneurial ADD on the 'wrapper' first - the 'look and feel' of the offer (copy, creative, headlines). Then change the seasonality of the offer. Then change the duration. If you're still stuck, change what you are giving away for free or discount. Change the entire machine behind it only as a last resort." -- Chapter 16

### Testing Names

[DECISION_RULE] [Layer 3-tactical]
IF you have several working names THEN use 2-3 best names in your advertising campaign. Note the winner, use that as a control to test against with new names.

> "I honestly have no idea why some names win and others do not. So, don't be emotional about it. Keep trying. Keep striking out. Then try more." -- Chapter 16

---

## 8. ANTI-PATTERNS & WARNINGS

### Scarcity Anti-Patterns

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER over-order inventory. It is better to sell out consistently than fail at creating scarcity.

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER run limited releases too often. Once a month is the sweet spot.

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER satisfy all demand at once. This kills future demand and makes each successive launch weaker.

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER use the no-return scarcity tactic with large groups. It loses teeth at scale.

### Urgency Anti-Patterns

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER use fake countdown timers or deadlines. "Make sure they are real. If they aren't, you'll lose credibility and just look like every other wannabe marketer."

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER fear losing sales by turning business away. "Every experienced marketer on the planet will tell you - it is a fear, and it is unfounded."

### Bonus Anti-Patterns

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER discount the main offer to close a deal. It teaches customers prices are negotiable. Add bonuses instead.

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER present bonuses in group selling the same way as 1-on-1 (the chapter notes this is beyond scope but flags the distinction).

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER offer additional trainings when tools/checklists would serve better. "Tools & checklists are better than additional trainings (as the effort & time are lower with the former, so the value is higher)."

### Guarantee Anti-Patterns

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER state a guarantee without the "or what" portion. "Without the 'or what' portion of the guarantee, it sounds weak and diluted."

Bad: "We will get you 20 clients guaranteed."
Must include: what happens if you don't deliver.

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER use strong unconditional guarantees with high-cost services. "If you have a tremendous amount of cost associated with your product or service, you will likely want to employ a conditional guarantee or an ANTI guarantee, as you will have to eat the cost of the refund AND the cost of fulfilling."

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER use a guarantee to cover up a poor product. "Guarantees are enhancers. They can enhance the magnetism or attraction of any offer, but they cannot make a business. If a guarantee is used to cover up a poor sales team or a poor product, it will backfire into lots of refunds."

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
WARNING: "People who buy because of guarantees can become very shitty customers. A person who only buys because of a guarantee is a person who may not be willing to put in the work necessary to see success."

### Naming Anti-Patterns

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER pair a quantifiable outcome claim with a time duration on advertising platforms. Most platforms will not approve "income gain in X days" messaging because it implies a guarantee.

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER force rhyming or alliteration. "Don't try and force it."

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER change the core offer when only the wrapper needs changing. "Change here usually just creates inefficiency and operational drag, costing you money."

### Offer Fatigue Anti-Patterns

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER assume the offer is fatigued just because you reached the audience once. "Most people don't even notice an offer on the first mention."

[ANTI_PATTERN] [Layer 2-strategic]
NEVER jump to changing your monetization structure when lighter changes (creative, copy, headline) would suffice. Follow the variation hierarchy from lightest to heaviest.

## 9. AGENT INSTRUCTIONS (Synthesized)

### Offer Enhancement Checklist

When enhancing or writing an offer, apply these in order:

**Step 1: Core Offer (prerequisite)**
- Confirm the offer solves all perceived problems (from Part 1 extraction)
- Confirm the offer bundle is trimmed (high value, low cost items kept)
- Confirm deliverables are enumerated as component parts

**Step 2: Apply Scarcity**
- [ ] Determine which scarcity type fits:
  - Physical product? Use limited release (cap quantity, announce sold-out)
  - Service? Choose from: Total Business Cap / Growth Rate Cap / Cohort Cap / No-Return Policy
  - Either? Use Honest Scarcity (share capacity percentage)
- [ ] Set the scarcity number BELOW what you think you can sell
- [ ] Plan the "sold out" announcement
- [ ] If applicable, apply scarcity to bonuses too

**Step 3: Apply Urgency**
- [ ] Determine which urgency type fits:
  - Recurring enrollment? Use Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency
  - Ongoing offers? Use Rolling Seasonal Urgency (rename by season with dates)
  - Year-round sales? Use Pricing/Bonus-Based Urgency
  - Arbitrage/time-sensitive? Use Exploding Opportunity
- [ ] Add real deadlines (never fake)
- [ ] If raising prices, clean the pipeline first

**Step 4: Stack Bonuses**
- [ ] Break the offer into component parts and present as bonuses
- [ ] For each bonus, follow the 11 Bonus Bullets:
  1. Always offer them
  2. Give a benefit-rich name
  3. Tell: relates to issue, what it is, how discovered, how it improves life
  4. Provide proof
  5. Paint vivid mental image of benefits experienced
  6. Ascribe and justify a price tag
  7. Prefer tools/checklists over trainings
  8. Address a specific concern/obstacle
  9. Solve their NEXT problem before they encounter it
  10. Total bonus value should ECLIPSE core offer value
  11. Add scarcity/urgency to individual bonuses
- [ ] Seek partner bonuses (other businesses' products/services for free)
- [ ] For 1-on-1 selling: ask for sale first, reveal bonuses after (or use as objection handlers if they say no)

**Step 5: Craft Guarantee**
- [ ] Identify the prospect's biggest fear/risk
- [ ] Choose guarantee type:
  - Low ticket B2C? Unconditional (broad)
  - High ticket B2B? Conditional (specific)
  - High fulfillment cost? Anti-guarantee or conditional
  - Just starting? Service guarantee or performance model
  - Want maximum power? Stack guarantees
- [ ] Apply the power formula: "If you do not get [X result] in [Y time], we will [Z]"
- [ ] Name the guarantee something creative
- [ ] Do the math: will the increased sales outweigh increased refunds?

**Step 6: Name the Offer**
- [ ] Apply M-A-G-I-C formula (use 3-5 components):
  - M: Magnetic reason why (seasonal, event, discount, free)
  - A: Avatar call-out (be hyper-specific, hyper-local if applicable)
  - G: Goal/dream outcome (specific, tangible)
  - I: Time interval (avoid with quantifiable claims on ad platforms)
  - C: Container word (Challenge, Blueprint, Bootcamp, etc.)
- [ ] Try rhyming (don't force)
- [ ] Try alliteration (don't force)
- [ ] Generate 5-10 name variants, test 2-3
- [ ] Apply M-A-G-I-C formula to EACH bonus/sub-item too

### Decision Tree: Scarcity Type Selection

```
START
  |
  Is it a physical product?
  YES --> Limited release (cap quantity, monthly cadence, announce sold-out)
  NO --> Is it a service?
         YES --> How many clients can you handle?
                 |
                 Fixed total? --> Total Business Cap
                 Fixed per week? --> Growth Rate Cap
                 Fixed per cohort? --> Cohort Cap
                 Very small exclusive group? --> Add No-Return Policy
         |
         ALL --> Layer on Honest Scarcity (share % to capacity)
         |
         Want extreme premium? --> Cap 1-on-1 access at tiny number, price high
```

### Decision Tree: Urgency Type Selection

```
START
  |
  Do you start clients in groups/cohorts?
  YES --> Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency
         (less frequent = more powerful)
  NO --> Is this a seasonal or time-bound promotion?
         YES --> Rolling Seasonal Urgency
                (new wrapper + date on same core service)
         NO --> Can you rotate pricing/bonus deals?
                YES --> Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency
                       (urgency on the DEAL, not the service)
                NO --> Is there an arbitrage/time-decay opportunity?
                       YES --> Exploding Opportunity
                       NO --> Create a cohort structure to unlock urgency
```

### Decision Tree: Guarantee Type Selection

```
START
  |
  What is your fulfillment cost?
  |
  LOW COST --> How confident in results?
               VERY --> Unconditional (full refund, or outsized refund)
               MODERATE --> Conditional + Service Guarantee
               LOW --> Anti-Guarantee (all sales final + reason why)
  |
  HIGH COST --> Can you tie success to client actions?
                YES --> Conditional Guarantee
                       (tie conditions to key success actions)
                NO --> Anti-Guarantee
                       OR Implied/Performance model
  |
  ANY --> Can you stack?
          Unconditional 30-day + Conditional 90-day = Maximum power
          Conditional + Conditional (sequential outcomes) = Future-pacing
  |
  STARTING OUT --> Begin with Service Guarantee or Performance Partnership
                   --> Graduate to less restrictive guarantees as you scale
```

### Decision Tree: Naming Components

```
For each offer name, select 3-5 from:

M (Magnetic Reason Why)
  - Free, X% off, Giveaway
  - Seasonal: Spring, Summer, Back to School, New Year
  - Event: Grand Opening, Anniversary, New Management

A (Avatar)
  - Hyper-local area + demographic
  - Industry + role
  - Lifestyle descriptor

G (Goal)
  - Dream outcome as specific noun/phrase
  - Feeling, experience, or measurable result

I (Interval)
  - Duration in minutes/hours/days/weeks/months
  - CAUTION: Don't pair with quantifiable claims on ad platforms

C (Container)
  - Challenge, Blueprint, Bootcamp, Intensive, etc.

ENHANCEMENTS:
  - Try rhyming (Six-Pack Fast Track)
  - Try alliteration (Make Money Masterclass)
  - Keep it short and punchy
```

### Rules Ranked by Impact

1. **Always include the "or what" in guarantees** -- the #1 conversion lever according to Fladlien (2-4x)
2. **Bonus value must eclipse core offer value** -- biggest price-to-value discrepancy driver
3. **Never discount; add bonuses instead** -- maintains price integrity
4. **Always sell out (plan scarcity below demand)** -- compounds over time
5. **Always announce sold-out** -- social proof + increased future desire
6. **Use real deadlines** -- fake ones destroy credibility
7. **Name everything with M-A-G-I-C** -- including sub-items and bonuses
8. **Present bonuses after first ask in 1-on-1** -- reinforces decision or handles objection
9. **Change the wrapper before changing the offer** -- lightest variation first
10. **Start with service guarantees, graduate to unconditional** -- lowest risk path
