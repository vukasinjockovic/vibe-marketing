Given a 10 percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you're still going to be wrong nine times out of ten . . . We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot, but you're also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.\" \n\n Jeff Bezos \n\n \n\n \n\n ",

We are gamblers ― gambling our hard-earned money on labor, inventory, rent, marketing, etc., all with the hopes of a higher pay out. Oftentimes, we lose. But, sometimes, we win and win BIG.\n\n However, there is a difference between gambling in business and gambling in a casino. In a casino, the odds are stacked against you. With skill, you can improve them, but never beat them. In contrast, in business, you can improve your skills to shift the odds in your favor . Simply stated, with enough skill, you can become the house.\n\n After beginning a series of books on acquisition, it became apparent that I could not talk about any other topic without first addressing the offer : the starting point of any conversation to initiate a transaction with a customer.

Specifically, how to reliably turn advertising dollars into (enormous) profits using a combination of pricing, value, guarantees, and naming strategies. I call the proper combination of these components: a Grand Slam Offer .\n\n I chose this term partially in homage to the above quote from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and because, like a grand slam in baseball, a Grand Slam Offer is both very good and very rare. Additionally, to extend the baseball metaphor, it takes no more effort to make a Grand Slam Offer than to strike out. The difference is dictated by the skill of the marketer and how well he connects his offer with his audience’s desires. In business you can have so-so offers: the “singles” and “doubles’ that keep the game going, pay the bills, and keep the lights on.",

It would be like connecting with the ball so well during one single at bat that you automatically win every World Series for the next hundred years.\n\n It takes years of practice to make something as complicated as hitting a major league fastball into the bleachers look effortless. Your stance, vision, prediction, ball speed, bat speed, and hip placement all must be perfect. In marketing and customer acquisition (the process of getting new clients), there are just as many variables that must all align to truly “knock it out of the park.” But with enough practice and enough skill, you can turn the wild world of acquisition, which will throw curveballs at you everyday, into a homerun",

If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped. \n\n You must stick with whatever you pick long enough to have trial and error.

After that, it will depend on how narrow the niche is, or, what is called TAM (total addressable market). A business can really only grow to meet the total addressable market. That being said, for most people, getting to $10M per year is already a top .4% achievement (only 1 in 250 businesses achieve this). So for 99.6 percent of readers below $10M per year, it’s almost always easier to serve fewer clients more narrowly .

When you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product. Wait, what? Yes.\n\n Higher Price Means Higher Value (Literally) \n\n In a blind taste test, researchers asked consumers to rate three wines: a low-priced wine, a medium-priced wine and an expensive wine. Throughout the study, the participants rated the wines with the prices visible. They rated them, unsurprisingly, in order of their price, with the most expensive being the “best,” the second most expensive being “second best,” and the third, cheapest option, being rated as “cheap wine.”",

Yet, the tasters reported a wide discrepancy between the “high priced” wine and the “cheap” wine. This has deep implications for the direct relationship between value and price.\n\n In essence, raising your prices can directly enhance the value you provide. What’s more, the higher the price, the more allure your product or service has. People want to buy expensive things. They just need a reason. And the goal isn’t just to be slightly above the market price — the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, “This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.” \n\n That is how you create a category of one. In this new perceived marketplace, you are a monopoly and can make monopoly profits. That is the point.",

The more invested they are, the more likely they are to achieve the positive result. Therefore, it follows that if you care about your customers, you should get them as invested as humanly possible. Ideally, this means pricing your services or product in such a way that it stings a little when they buy. That sting will force and focus their attention and their investment in your product or service. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention.

In a real way, we were charging on a fraction of what our clients made using our system. This is important. Our clients still got a deal .

This is what marriages are lost over, wars are fought over, and people will willingly die for. Our goal is not to create desire. It’s simply to channel that desire through our offer and monetization vehicle.\n\n The dream outcome is the expression of the feelings and experiences the prospect has envisioned in their mind. It’s the gap between their current reality and their dreams. Our goal is to accurately depict that dream back to them, so they feel understood, and explain how our vehicle will get them there.\n\n The dream outcome is simple; it’s the “getting there” where the value gets enhanced or detracted.",

Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40 yards past theirs . . . they’ll ask you what’s changed . . . only you will know.\n\n \n\n \n\n That being said, when comparing two products or services that satisfy the same desire, the value from the dream outcomes will cancel out (since they are the same).

These are little milestones a prospect sees along the way that shows them they are on the right path. We try and tie as many of these as possible into any service we offer.

I wanted so deeply to be successful, prove my dad wrong about my decision to start my own business, and prove to myself that I was worth something.

They said they wouldn't bother because $99/mo afterwards was still too much, and they didn't want to start something they wouldn't continue with.\n\n It’s a new level of frustration when you can’t even give your services away for free to people.

So here’s what I ended up doing to fill their gyms: I would fly out to their gym for 21 days, spend my own money on hotels, car rentals, eating out, advertising, generate the leads, work the leads, then sell for them. I would even do the first onboarding meeting with clients to get them started. In short, I did everything .",

So they had 0 financial risk, 0 time risk, 0 effort, and the deal was, I got to keep all the up front cash collected from selling their services, and they got clients for free. You can imagine how this was a pretty compelling offer.\n\n On my own, I was able to sell about $100,000/mo in up front cash for myself. So these deals were very lucrative for me. Over time, I scaled that to a team of 8 guys selling every month. But this began to wear on me and the team. It was at that point that I realized that if I were to simply teach them how to do what I did, I could charge maybe a third of what I would normally make, but I would be able to help hundreds of gyms a month instead of eight.

As a result, I lost many sales.\n\n One month I really needed to make some sales to pay rent. My next sale walked in the door - it was a business exec looking to lose weight. As we got into the sales presentation, she told me the program wouldn’t work for her because she went out to eat for lunch everyday. Normally, I would have lost this sale. I was a stickler for making people not eat out. But I really needed the money. Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing , I conceded “I’ll make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat our 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal.",

Better yet, depending which meals they selected, would tell them what they needed to buy at the grocery store in exact amounts, and how to prepare them in bulk for their exact amounts.

We artificially increase the demand for our products and services through some sort of persuasive communication. When we increase the demand, we can sell more units. When we decrease supply, we can sell those units for more money. The “perfect profit combination” is lots of demand, and very little supply, or perceived supply.

As soon as we have them, our desire for them disappears. Therefore, if we seek to increase the demand (or desire), we must decrease or delay satisfying the desires of our prospects. We must sell fewer units than we otherwise can . Let that sit with you for a second.\n\n Consider this example. We promote some two-day workshop that is upcoming. First we whisper that it’s coming.

Let’s attack some real-world, in-the-trenches strategies to reliably create scarcity .\n\n Creating Scarcity \n\n When there’s a fixed supply or quantity of products or services that are available for purchase it creates “scarcity” or a “fear of missing out.” It increases the need to take action, and by extension, purchase your offer. This is where you publicly share that you are only giving away X amount of products or can only handle Y new clients.\n\n For example, if a musician drops a limited edition hoodie and says he only made 100 and they will never be made again, are you more or less likely to buy it than one that is always available? More likely, naturally. The idea that you can never get it again makes it more desirable.",

Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain . We will wield this psychological lever to get your clients to buy in a frenzy, all at once, until you are sold out .\n\n Three Types of Scarcity \n\n \n Limited Supply of Seats/Slots: in general or over X period of time.\n\n Limited Supply of Bonuses\n\n Never available again.\n\n \n But how do you use this properly without being phony?

You can have limited releases for flavors, colors, designs, sizes, etc. “This month, we are releasing 100 boxes of mint chocolate cookie flavored protein bars.” Important point: to properly utilize this method you should always sell out. \n\n Here’s why: it’s better to sell out consistently than over order and fail at creating that scarcity.

And now that the choice has been made for them, they desire it more because there is no way they can get it. So the next time you make the offer they will be far more likely to take you up on it.\n\n Fun fact: Chanel, a brand that has maintained insane margins and pricing for over a century, is a master of scarcity.

But I will show you a few simple ways to employ scarcity ethically to increase your take rates on offers. These all have similar elements with very slight tweaks. I'm enumerating these because one of these might mentally fit your business model more than others.\n\n 1. Total Business Cap - Only accepting….X Clients. Only accepting X clients at this level of service (on-going). This puts a cap on how many clients you service but also keeps them in it. You create a waiting list for new prospects. The moment the door opens, they jump right in and price resistance disappears. Periodically, you can increase capacity by 10-20% then cap it again.

Growth Rate Cap - Only accepting X clients per week (on-going) “We only accept 5 new clients per week and we already have the first 3 spots taken. I have 6 more calls this week, so you can take the spot or one of my next calls and you can wait until we reopen.” I have used this method since the beginning of my business.

Price it very high. Then, tell people. You will make more money than you thought possible. These also tend to be some of the best clients. And limit your delivery to something that you don’t hate.

It would be a lie to say that if you own a roofing business you won’t service them if they buy after the date. But, if you talk specifically about the promotion you can often elicit the same urgency on buying in the prospect while maintaining your integrity — win-win. You can interchange a pricing promotion, discount, or added bonuses like free install or free onboarding or an extra workshop (valued at $1,000) if they buy now. These are all things you can swap around your core offer to create urgency.",

This could be true for selling someone on the opportunity of trading crypto currencies, buying a stock, getting into a new platform to advertise before competitors jump on the bandwagon. Highly competitive job environments often get job offers that are “exploding offers” everyday they wait to take the job, their pay or bonuses decrease. This forces prospects to make fast decisions rather than try and “wait it out” to see if they get a better offer.\n\n All of these examples show opportunities that decay with time, so if you find yourself in front of an opportunity like this, make sure to emphasize it!",

They are so powerful that they earned an entire chapter. In this chapter, I’m going to cover: what to offer, how to pick them, how to value them, how to present them, how to price them.\n\n The main point I want you to take away from this is that a single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses (see image) . The entirety of our offer we came up with at the end of the last section. This section is about how to present those pieces in what order. For example, I may in fact do lots of things in my service, but until I enumerate them, they are unknown. This is why every infomercial of all time continues on with “but wait….there’s more!”",

This is why every infomercial of all time continues on with “but wait….there’s more!”\n\n They would not use these techniques unless they were effective, as every second of air time costs money and must be justified with ROI. You’ll also notice that if you watch those old infomercials, they would sell one knife for $38.95 then include 37 other knives, sharpeners, pans, and guarantees to beat the prospect into submission. They establish the price, then they expand upon it until you feel it’s such a good deal it would be stupid to pass it up .\n\n The reason this works is we are increasing the prospect’s price-to-value discrepancy by increasing the value delivered instead of cutting the price. We anchor the price we tell them to the core offer. Then with each increasingly valuable bonus, that discrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket.",

It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable (which is terrible). Adding bonuses to increase value to close the deal is far superior to cutting prices.

You simply agree with the prospect, add the bonus, and ask if this consolation was “Fair enough.” People have a hard time rejecting reciprocity, so adding a bonus to accommodate, then another, then another, and people will feel almost obligated to buy from you.\n\n If you recall from our “Trim and Stack” chapter, each of those deliverables is now being weaponized and presented at the perfect time.

So an absolute increase in sales of 5 percent would need to be offset by an absolute increase in refunds of 5 percent (but that might be a doubling of refunds, which is unlikely).

This gets a LOT more people to buy, but you will have some people refund, especially as consumer culture continues to shift towards entitlement and zero accountability.\n\n 2) Conditional Guarantees \n\n Conditional guarantees include “terms and conditions” to the guarantee. These are the ones you can get VERY creative on. In general, you want these to be “better than money back” guarantees.

Unique to this particular structure, it also confers the upside of “If I do a great job, I will be very well compensated.” These only work in situations where you have transparency for measuring the outcome and trust (or control) that you will get compensated when you do perform.\n\n Stacking Guarantees \n\n An experienced salesman understands that, like bonuses, you can actually stack guarantees.

As long as you know the math, you will typically make up for the refunds in spaces with higher and faster closing on the sales side. But you have to be good at fulfilling your promises. If not, steer clear. I believe this offer works much better in lower-ticket situations. It becomes very risky as you go into higher-ticket services with higher costs of fulfillment.\n\n \n \n Pro Tip: Unconditional vs Conditional Based on Business Type \n\n Bigger broader guarantees work better with lower ticket B2C businesses (many people just won't bother taking the time).

There is an implied guarantee whenever you enter into a revshare or performance partnership: if you dont make money, you don't have to pay me. In my opinion, this is one of, if not THE most desirable setup. First because it makes you accountable to your clients' results. Second it weeds out low performers.

I've seen countless agencies go from $20k/mo to $200k+/mo in a matter of a few months.\n\n You can also pair a revshare or performance setup with a minimum. It would be like saying “we get the greater of $1000 or 10% of revenue generated.” So if the client doesn’t generate money because of whatever reason this at least covers your costs of services etc.\n\n Or saying we get $1000/mo for the first 3 months, then after that, it switches to 100% performance.

It’s that important.\n\n I have personally used all the guarantees listed above (except for the hotel and phone call one, which I just saw and liked). But you can come up with your own! The key is to identify a client’s biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles. “What do they not want to have happen if they pay you?

It’s easier to get to work, but harder to keep working or scale. And the reason is - in local markets, it’s easier because there’ is trust in the familiar. So selling in- person at higher prices in a local market is inherently easier. It means you will convert a much higher percentage of your leads. This makes marketing work most of the time.\n\n The downside of local marketing is that offers fatigue rapidly because there is only a limited radius that a local business can serve. To reference an earlier concept, the TAM (total addressable market) for a brick & mortar is only its immediate radius (most times). So by extension, the smaller the radius, the faster offers fatigue.
