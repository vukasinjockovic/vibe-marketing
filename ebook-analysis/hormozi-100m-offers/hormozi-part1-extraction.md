# 1. DECISION RULES

## DR-001: The Offer Hierarchy Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 0-foundational

IF you are starting or growing a business, THEN the offer is the first thing to get right -- before marketing, before sales, before operations.

> "After beginning a series of books on acquisition, it became apparent that I could not talk about any other topic without first addressing the offer: the starting point of any conversation to initiate a transaction with a customer."
> -- Start Here

**Agent instruction:** When building any landing page, sales page, or marketing asset, begin with the offer. Do not write copy until the offer structure is defined.

---

## DR-002: The Offer Quality Cascade
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 0-foundational

IF offer quality = none, THEN no business, no life.
IF offer quality = bad, THEN negative profit, no business, miserable life.
IF offer quality = decent, THEN no profit, stagnating business.
IF offer quality = good, THEN some profit, okay business.
IF offer quality = Grand Slam, THEN fantastic profit, insane business, freedom.

> "No offer? No business. No life. Bad offer? Negative profit. No business. Miserable life. Decent offer? No profit. Stagnating business. Stagnating life. Good offer? Some profit. Okay business. Okay life. Grand Slam Offer? Fantastic profit. Insane business. Freedom."
> -- Chapter 2

---

## DR-003: Commodity vs. Differentiated Decision
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 1-theoretical

IF your product can be compared directly to competitors, THEN you are commoditized and will compete on price (race to the bottom).
IF your product cannot be compared to anything else, THEN you sell on value in a "category of one."

> "Commoditized = Price Driven Purchases (race to the bottom). Differentiated = Value Driven Purchases (sell in a category of one with no comparison.)"
> -- Chapter 3

**Agent instruction:** When writing offer copy, the offer MUST be structured so it cannot be directly compared to competitors. If a prospect can say "this is the same as X but cheaper/more expensive," the offer has failed.

---

## DR-004: The Starving Crowd Priority Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 0-foundational

IF you must choose between a great market, a great offer, or great persuasion skills, THEN prioritize in this order:

> "Starving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills"
> -- Chapter 4

IF market = great, THEN you will make money even with a bad offer and bad persuasion.
IF market = normal AND offer = great (Grand Slam), THEN you will make tons of money even with bad persuasion.
IF market = normal AND offer = normal, THEN you must be exceptionally good at persuasion to succeed.

> "Example #1: Even if you have a bad offer and are bad at persuasion, you're going to make money if you're in a great market."
> "Example #2 (most of us): If you are in a normal market and have a Grand Slam Offer (great), you can make tons of money even if you're bad at persuasion."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## DR-005: The Four Market Indicators Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2-strategic

IF selecting a market, THEN evaluate all four indicators. A market must have ALL of:

1. **Massive Pain** -- they desperately need (not just want) the solution
2. **Purchasing Power** -- they can actually afford to pay
3. **Easy to Target** -- you can find and reach them through associations, lists, groups, channels
4. **Growing** -- the market is expanding, not shrinking

IF any one indicator is missing (especially growth), THEN the market will fail you no matter how good your offer is.

> "He had looked at all the angles, except for the most obvious one [his market was shrinking by 25 percent every year]."
> -- Chapter 4 (Lloyd / newspapers example)

---

## DR-006: The Three Core Markets Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 1-theoretical

IF choosing a market category, THEN it must fall within one of three evergreen categories:

> "There are three main markets that will always exist: Health, Wealth, and Relationships. The reason that those will always exist is that there is always tremendous pain when you lack them."
> -- Chapter 4

IF your offer does not connect to health, wealth, or relationships, THEN reconsider the market.

---

## DR-007: The Niche Commitment Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2-strategic

IF you have chosen a niche, THEN commit to it. Do not switch until you have exhausted offer variations within that niche.

> "Too often, a newer entrepreneur half-heartedly tries one offer in one market, doesn't make a million dollars, then mistakenly thinks 'this is a bad market.' Most times that's not actually the case. They just haven't found a Grand Slam Offer yet to apply to that market."
> -- Chapter 4

IF you are under $10M/year revenue, THEN niche down further, do not broaden.

> "For most, if you are under $10M per year, niching down will make you more money."
> -- Chapter 4, Author Note

---

## DR-008: The 100x Niche Pricing Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2-strategic

IF you niche down your product, THEN you can charge dramatically more (up to 100x) for the same core content.

> "Time Management" ($19) -> "Time Management for Sales Professionals" ($99) -> "Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps" ($499) -> "Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools & Gardening Sales Reps" ($1000-$2000)

> "You want to be 'the guy' who services 'this type of person' or solves 'this type of problem.' And even more niched 'I solve this type of problem for this specific type of person in this unique counter-intuitive way that reverses their deepest fear.'"
> -- Chapter 4

---

## DR-009: The Premium Pricing Imperative
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 1-theoretical

IF you are setting prices, THEN charge premium. Never compete on price unless you have a revolutionary 1/10th cost advantage.

> "There is no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being the most expensive."
> -- Chapter 5 (quoting Dan Kennedy)

IF you lower prices, THEN you trigger a vicious cycle: lower emotional investment -> lower perceived value -> worse results -> worst clients -> destroyed margins.
IF you raise prices, THEN you trigger a virtuous cycle: higher emotional investment -> higher perceived value -> better results -> best clients -> multiplied margins.

---

## DR-010: The Price-Value Gap Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 1-theoretical

IF you want to charge more, THEN you must first increase perceived value, THEN raise price -- maintaining a large gap where value >> price.

> "So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value."
> -- Chapter 5

> "The simplest way to increase the gap between price to value is by lowering the price. It's also, most of the time, the wrong decision for the business."
> -- Chapter 5

---

## DR-011: The Value Equation Bottom-Side Focus Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2-strategic

IF you are early in your career, THEN you will focus on dream outcomes and perceived likelihood (top of equation) -- this is the easy, lazy approach.
IF you want to build something exceptional, THEN focus on decreasing Time Delay and Effort & Sacrifice (bottom of equation) -- this is the hard, competitive approach.

> "In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement... But as time has gone on, I have realized that these larger-than-life claims are the easiest to establish (and therefore less unique). After all, anyone can make a promise. The harder, and more competitive, are the Time Delay and Effort & Sacrifice."
> -- Chapter 6

> "The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation. Making things immediate, seamless, and effortless. Apple made the iPhone effortless compared to other phones at the time. Amazon made purchasing a single click of a button and made purchases arrive almost immediately."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## DR-012: The Psychological vs. Logical Solutions Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2-strategic

IF a logical solution already exists for a problem, THEN it has likely been tried. Look for a psychological solution instead.

> "Most people naturally try and solve problems using logical solutions. But the logical solutions have usually been tried...because they're logical (it's what everyone would try and do)."
> -- Chapter 6, Pro Tip

Examples:
- Logical: make trains faster -> Psychological: add a dotted map showing when next train arrives
- Logical: make elevator faster -> Psychological: add floor-to-ceiling mirrors
- Logical: make it cheaper -> Psychological: make fewer and raise the price

---

## DR-013: The "Sell the Vacation, Not the Flight" Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 3-tactical

IF writing offer copy, THEN describe the destination (dream outcome), not the mechanism (the process/membership/service).

> "I wasn't selling my membership anymore. I wasn't selling the plane flight. I was selling the vacation. When you are thinking about your dream outcome, it has to be them arriving at their destination and what they would like to experience."
> -- Chapter 9

---

## DR-014: The "Solve Every Problem" Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2-strategic

IF a prospect raises an objection or perceived obstacle, THEN you MUST solve it, not dismiss it. Each unsolved problem is a lost sale.

> "Don't get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with. When you do that, you make an offer that's so good, people just can't say no."
> -- Chapter 10

> "You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people."
> -- Chapter 10

---

## DR-015: The Sales-Fulfillment Continuum Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2-strategic

IF you are starting out, THEN over-deliver like crazy (easy to sell, hard to fulfill). Use the cash flow to optimize operations.
IF you are scaling, THEN add friction and reduce what you deliver while maintaining value.

> "I have always lived by the mantra, 'Create flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction.' This means I generate demand first. Then, with my offer, I get them to say yes. Once I have people saying yes, then, and only then, will I add friction in my marketing, or decide to offer less for the same price."
> -- Chapter 10

---

## DR-016: The Trim Decision Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 3-tactical

When trimming your solutions list:
1. FIRST remove: high cost, low value items
2. THEN remove: low cost, low value items
3. KEEP: low cost, high value items AND high cost, high value items

> "Next, I look at the cost of providing these solutions to me (the business). I remove the ones that are high cost and low value first. Then I remove low cost, low value items."
> -- Chapter 10

---

## DR-017: The "One to Many" Priority Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 3-tactical

IF choosing a delivery vehicle, THEN prioritize "one to many" solutions. These have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value.

> "If there's one type of delivery vehicle to focus on, it's creating high value, 'one to many' solutions. These will be the ones that typically have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value."
> -- Chapter 10

---

## DR-018: The Status Frame Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 3-tactical

IF writing benefit copy, THEN frame benefits in terms of STATUS gained, as perceived by others.

> "Pro Tip: Frame benefits in terms of status gained from the viewpoint of others. When writing copy, you can make it that much more powerful by talking about how other people will perceive the prospect's achievement."
> -- Chapter 6

Example provided:
> "If you buy this golf club, your drive will increase by 40 yards. Your golf buddies' jaws will drop when they see your ball soar 40 yards past theirs... they'll ask you what's changed... only you will know."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## DR-019: The Fast Beats Free Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2-strategic

IF you are competing against free alternatives, THEN compete on speed. Speed beats free.

> "The only thing that beats 'free' is 'fast.' People will pay for speed."
> -- Chapter 6, Pro Tip

Examples: MVD vs DMV, FedEx vs USPS, Spotify vs free music, Uber vs walking.

---

## DR-020: The Fast Win Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 3-tactical

IF you sell something with a long time-to-result, THEN create an early emotional win as close to purchase as possible.

> "Always try and incorporate short-term, immediate wins for a client. Be creative. They just need to know they are on the right path and that they made the right decision trusting you and your business."
> -- Chapter 6, Pro Tip

> "People who experience a victory early on are more likely to continue with something than those who do not."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## DR-021: The Price-Creates-Value Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 1-theoretical

IF you raise your price, THEN you literally increase the perceived value -- even if the product is identical.

> "When you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product."
> -- Chapter 5

Wine study: identical wines were rated dramatically differently based solely on perceived price.

> "The goal isn't just to be slightly above the market price -- the goal is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves, 'This is so much more expensive, there must be something entirely different going on here.'"
> -- Chapter 5

---

## DR-022: The Pain is the Pitch Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 3-tactical

IF writing sales copy or a pitch, THEN articulate the prospect's pain accurately. If you do this well, they will almost always buy.

> "I have a saying I use to train sales teams 'The pain is the pitch.' If you can articulate the pain a prospect is feeling accurately, they will almost always buy what you are offering."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## DR-023: The Persuasion vs. Understanding Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 3-tactical

IF writing marketing copy, THEN the goal is for the prospect to feel understood, not for them to understand you.

> "The point of good writing is for the reader to understand. The point of good persuasion is for the prospect to feel understood."
> -- Chapter 4, Pro Tip

---

## DR-024: The Conviction Rule
**Tag:** DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2-strategic

IF you want to charge premium prices, THEN your conviction in your product must be stronger than the prospect's skepticism.

> "This was possible because my conviction was stronger than their skepticism."
> -- Chapter 5

> "In the real world, to have the 'gonads' to charge big ticket prices, you must outwork your self doubt."
> -- Chapter 5

---

# 2. FORMULAS & TEMPLATES

## F-001: The Value Equation (EXACT)
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 0-foundational

```
Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)
```

The four primary drivers:

**TOP (increase these):**
1. **(Yay) The Dream Outcome** (Goal: Increase)
2. **(Yay) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement** (Goal: Increase)

**BOTTOM (decrease these):**
3. **(Boo) Perceived Time Delay Between Start and Achievement** (Goal: Decrease)
4. **(Boo) Perceived Effort & Sacrifice** (Goal: Decrease)

> "As you can see from the picture, there are four primary drivers of value. Two of the drivers (on top), you will seek to increase. The other two (on the bottom), you will seek to decrease."
> -- Chapter 6

**Why division, not addition:**
> "The reason this is a division equation and not an addition ('+') is that I wanted to convey one key point. If you can make the bottom part of the equation equal to zero, you're golden. No matter how small the top side is, anything divided by zero equals infinity."
> -- Chapter 6

**The infinite value test:** If the prospect clicks "buy" and instantly gets the dream outcome with zero effort, that is infinite value.

---

## F-002: The Three Growth Levers Formula
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 1-theoretical

There are only three ways to grow a business:

1. Get more customers
2. Increase their average purchase value
3. Get them to buy more times

> "10 New Clients/mo x $1000 Lifetime Value = $10,000/mo max revenue."
> -- Chapter 3

Simplified to two:
> "There are really only two ways to grow: get more customers, and increase each customer's value."
> -- Chapter 3, Author Note

---

## F-003: Grand Slam Offer Definition (EXACT)
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 0-foundational

> "It's an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers... forever removing the cash constraint on business growth."
> -- Chapter 3

A Grand Slam Offer produces three multiplicative effects:
1. **Increased Response Rates** (more clicks/actions on ads)
2. **Increased Conversion** (more people buy)
3. **Premium Prices** (charging a lot of money)

> "If you pay the same amount for eyeballs but 1) more people respond, 2) more of those responses buy, and 3) they buy for higher prices, your business grows."
> -- Chapter 3

---

## F-004: The Grand Slam Offer Creation Process (5 Steps)
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 0-foundational

**Step #1: Identify Dream Outcome**
Define what the prospect actually wants (the destination, not the vehicle).

**Step #2: List Problems**
List ALL obstacles the prospect will encounter before, during, and after using your product/service. Think in insane detail. Use the four value drivers as a guide for each problem area:
- Dream Outcome concerns ("This will not be financially worth it")
- Likelihood of Achievement concerns ("It won't work for me specifically")
- Effort & Sacrifice concerns ("This will be too hard, confusing")
- Time concerns ("This will take too much time")

**Step #3: Create Solutions List**
Transform every problem into a solution using "How to [reverse the problem]" framing. This is the solutions list.

**Step #4: Create Delivery Vehicles ("The How")**
For each solution, brainstorm all possible ways to deliver it. Use the Product Delivery Cheat Codes (see F-005).

**Step #5: Trim & Stack**
- 5a: Remove high-cost/low-value items, then low-cost/low-value items. Keep high-value items.
- 5b: Bundle remaining items into the final high-value deliverable with sexy names and assigned dollar values.

> "Step #1: We figured out our prospective client's dream outcome. Step #2: We listed out all the obstacles they're likely to encounter on their way (our opportunities for value). Step #3: We listed all those obstacles as solutions. Step #4: We figured out all the different ways we could deliver those solutions. Step #5a: We trimmed those ways down to only the things that were the highest value and lowest cost to us."
> -- Chapter 10

---

## F-005: Product Delivery Cheat Codes
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 3-tactical

When brainstorming delivery vehicles for solutions, vary across these dimensions:

1. **What level of personal attention?** one-on-one, small group, one to many
2. **What level of effort from them?** DIY (figure it out themselves), DWY (you teach them), DFY (you do it for them)
3. **If live, what medium?** In-person, phone, email, text, Zoom, chat
4. **If recorded, what format?** Audio, video, written
5. **How quickly do we reply?** 24/7, 9-5, within 5 minutes, within an hour, within 24 hours
6. **10x to 1/10th test:** "If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000) what would I provide? If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make my product more valuable than it already is, how would I do that?"

> -- Chapter 10

---

## F-006: Problem-to-Solution Conversion Template
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 3-tactical

For each problem, convert using this pattern:

```
PROBLEM: [Core activity prospect must do]
  ... is hard, confusing, I won't like it -> "How to make [activity] easy and enjoyable, so that anyone can do it"
  ... takes too much time -> "How to [activity] quickly"
  ... is expensive -> "How to [activity] for less than [current cost benchmark]"
  ... is unsustainable -> "How to make [activity] take less effort than [current bad alternative]"
  ... conflicts with other priorities -> "How to [activity] while also [handling competing priority]"
  ... fails in edge cases -> "How to [activity] even when [edge case]"
```

> -- Chapter 9 (buying food, cooking food, eating food examples)

---

## F-007: The Bundle Naming & Stacking Template
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 3-tactical

Format for presenting each bundle item in the final offer:

```
[Problem Area] -> [Sexy Name for Bundle] ... [benefit statement that addresses main pain point] ($[assigned value] value [+ reason for that value])
```

Example:
> "Buying food -> How anyone can buy food fast, easy, cheaply -> Foolproof Bargain Grocery System... that'll save hundreds of dollars per month on your food and take less time than your current shopping routine ($1,000 value for the money it'll save you from this point on in your life)"
> -- Chapter 10

Then list the actual delivery components underneath.

End with total value vs. actual price:
> "Total value: $4,351 (!) All for only $599."
> -- Chapter 10

---

## F-008: The Virtuous Cycle of Price
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 1-theoretical

**Vicious Cycle (lowering prices):**
Lower price -> lower emotional investment -> lower perceived value -> worse client results -> attracts worst clients -> destroys margins -> can't invest in quality -> worse service -> must lower prices further

**Virtuous Cycle (raising prices):**
Higher price -> higher emotional investment -> higher perceived value -> better client results -> attracts best clients -> multiplied margins -> invest in systems, people, experience -> better service -> can charge even more

> -- Chapter 5 (full cycle described across multiple paragraphs)

---

## F-009: Lifetime Value Formula
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 1-theoretical

> "Revenue: ($1,000/mo * 90% Gross Margin * 5 months) = $4,500 Lifetime Value (LTV)"
> -- Chapter 3

LTV = Monthly Revenue x Gross Margin % x Average Customer Lifespan (months)

---

## F-010: The Grand Slam Offer Multiplier Math
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 2-strategic

A Grand Slam Offer multiplies across three variables simultaneously:

> "You get 2.5x more people to respond to your advertisement because it's a more compelling offer. From there, you close 2.5x as many people because the offer is so much more compelling. From there, you are able to charge a 4x higher price up front. The end result is 2.5 x 2.5 x 4 = 22.4x more cash collected up front."
> -- Chapter 3

```
Response Rate Multiplier x Conversion Multiplier x Price Multiplier = Total Revenue Multiplier
```

---

## F-011: The Value Equation Four Questions (Prospect's Perspective)
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 3-tactical

Every prospect asks these four questions (consciously or unconsciously). Your offer must answer all four:

1. **"What will I make?"** (Dream Outcome)
2. **"How will I know it's going to happen?"** (Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)
3. **"How long will it take?"** (Time Delay)
4. **"What is expected of me?"** (Effort & Sacrifice)

> -- Chapter 6 (Hormozi's father conversation)

---

## F-012: The Four Problem Buckets per Obstacle
**Tag:** FORMULA | Layer: 3-tactical

For each obstacle/activity a prospect must perform, there are four negative elements (aligned with the value equation):

> "Dream Outcome -> This will not be financially worth it"
> "Likelihood of Achievement -> It won't work for me specifically. I won't be able to stick with it. External factors will get in my way."
> "Effort & Sacrifice -> This will be too hard, confusing. I won't like it. I will suck at it."
> "Time -> This will take too much time to do. I am too busy to do this. It will take too long to work. It won't be convenient for me."
> -- Chapter 9

---

# 3. PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

## P-001: The Grand Slam Offer as Category of One
**Tag:** PRINCIPLE | Layer: 0-foundational

A Grand Slam Offer eliminates comparison. The prospect's decision becomes "your product vs. nothing" rather than "your product vs. competitor."

> "It allows you to sell in a 'category of one,' or, to apply another great phrase, to 'sell in a vacuum.' The resulting purchasing decision for the prospect is now between your product and nothing."
> -- Chapter 3

**Mechanism:** When a prospect cannot compare your offer to alternatives, they cannot anchor on competitor prices. They must evaluate value independently, which means you set the price based on perceived value alone.

---

## P-002: Commoditization Destroys Margins
**Tag:** PRINCIPLE | Layer: 0-foundational

When multiple providers offer the same thing, the market drives price down to just above cost of delivery. This is "market efficiency" and it creates businesses that barely survive.

> "A commodity, as I define it, is a product available from many places. For that reason, it's prone to purchases based on 'price' instead of 'value.'"
> -- Chapter 3

> "The marketplace drives the price down through competition until the margins are just enough to keep the lights on."
> -- Chapter 3

**Mechanism:** Commoditization occurs when offers LOOK the same. The offer itself -- not the fulfillment -- is what must be differentiated.

> "A business does the same work in both cases (with a commoditized or a Grand Slam Offer). The fulfillment is the same. But if one business uses a Grand Slam Offer and another uses a 'commodity' offer, the Grand Slam Offer makes that business appear as if it has a totally different product."
> -- Chapter 3

---

## P-003: Grow or Die
**Tag:** PRINCIPLE | Layer: 0-foundational

> "'Grow or Die' is a core tenet at our companies. We believe every person, every company, and every organism is either growing or dying. Maintenance is a myth."
> -- Chapter 3

The stock market grows ~9% per year. If your business isn't growing at least that rate, you're falling behind. In growing markets, you may need 20-30% growth just to keep up.

---

## P-004: People Pay for Certainty
**Tag:** MECHANISM | Layer: 1-theoretical

The perceived likelihood of achievement is what people pay a premium for. Same service, different track record = dramatically different price.

> "For example, how much would you pay to be a plastic surgeon's 10,000th patient versus their first?"
> -- Chapter 6

**Agent instruction:** When writing offer copy, always include proof elements (testimonials, case studies, track record, guarantees) that increase the prospect's perception that THIS will work for THEM specifically.

---

## P-005: Status Drives All Purchase Decisions
**Tag:** MECHANISM | Layer: 1-theoretical

All purchases ultimately connect to perceived status increase or decrease within one's social group.

> "It's not about the money, it's about the status (the perceived increase or decrease in relative standing when compared to others socially or professionally)."
> -- Chapter 6

The Collette Brunson example: She preferred a minivan over a Lamborghini because the minivan INCREASED her status among mom friends while the Lamborghini would DECREASE it.

> "Talk in terms of things your prospect believes will increase their status, and you will have your prospects drooling."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## P-006: Perception is Reality
**Tag:** MECHANISM | Layer: 1-theoretical

It does not matter how much you ACTUALLY improve the four value drivers. It only matters how much the prospect PERCEIVES the improvement.

> "The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice."
> -- Chapter 6

London Underground example: A simple dotted map showing when the next train arrives increased satisfaction more than actually making trains faster.

---

## P-007: The Dream Outcome Cancellation Principle
**Tag:** MECHANISM | Layer: 2-strategic

When two competing products satisfy the same desire, the dream outcome cancels out. The remaining three value drivers (likelihood, time, effort) determine which is more valuable.

> "Simply put: if two things make someone beautiful, what makes one worth $50,000 and another $5? Answer: The extent of the other three value variables."
> -- Chapter 6

**Agent instruction:** When competing in a crowded market (where everyone promises the same outcome), differentiate on the BOTTOM of the value equation: speed, ease, certainty.

---

## P-008: The Done-For-You Premium Principle
**Tag:** MECHANISM | Layer: 2-strategic

"Done for you" services command higher prices than "do it yourself" because they reduce effort/sacrifice AND increase perceived likelihood of achievement.

> "This is why 'done for you services' are almost always more expensive than 'do-it-yourself' because the person doesn't have all the effort and sacrifice. There is also a component of 'perceived likelihood of achievement' difference as well."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## P-009: The Short-Term Experience / Long-Term Outcome Split
**Tag:** MECHANISM | Layer: 2-strategic

People BUY the long-term dream outcome. They STAY because of short-term experiences along the way.

> "The thing people buy is the long-term value, aka their 'dream outcome.' But the thing that makes them stay long enough to get it is the short-term experience."
> -- Chapter 6

**Agent instruction:** Every offer should include both the big promise (dream outcome) AND specific early wins that reinforce the purchase decision.

---

## P-010: The Investment-Attention Mechanism
**Tag:** MECHANISM | Layer: 1-theoretical

Higher price = more attention = better results = more value actually delivered.

> "Those who pay the most, pay the most attention. And if your customers are more adherent and follow through, and if they achieve better results with your service than your competition, then you are in a very real way providing more value than anyone else."
> -- Chapter 5

**Agent instruction:** When justifying premium pricing in copy, use this argument: paying more causes them to take it more seriously, which causes them to get better results. Therefore, the higher price IS the value.

---

## P-011: The Supply-Demand Psychology Principle
**Tag:** MECHANISM | Layer: 1-theoretical

> "Fundamentally, all marketing exists to influence the supply and demand curve."
> -- Chapter 11

The "perfect profit combination" is lots of demand with very little (perceived) supply. Enhancing your offer (scarcity, urgency, bonuses, guarantees) is designed to increase demand AND decrease perceived supply simultaneously.

---

## P-012: Divergent Thinking Creates Value
**Tag:** PRINCIPLE | Layer: 2-strategic

Convergent thinking (one answer to known variables) is what school teaches. Divergent thinking (many solutions to a single problem) is what business rewards.

> "Life will pay you for your ability to solve using a divergent thought process. In other words, think of many solutions to a single problem."
> -- Chapter 8

The "brick exercise" demonstrates this: a single object has dozens of uses when you vary its size, material, and shape. Similarly, a single customer problem has dozens of possible solution vehicles.

## P-013: One-Time Creation, Infinite Delivery
**Tag:** PRINCIPLE | Layer: 2-strategic

The most profitable delivery vehicles require high one-time creation cost but near-zero marginal cost per additional customer.

> "These types of solutions require a high, one-time cost of creation, but infinitely low additional effort after. (Fyi - This is exactly why software becomes so valuable)."
> -- Chapter 10

# 4. ANTI-PATTERNS & WARNINGS

## AP-001: Never Copy Competitor Pricing
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 2-strategic

> "Most business owners are not competing on price or value. In fact, they're not actually competing on anything at all. Their pricing process typically goes something like this: Look at marketplace. See what everyone else offers. Take the average. Go slightly below to remain 'competitive.' Provide what their competitors offers with a 'little more.' End up at a value proposition of 'more for less.'"
> -- Chapter 5

> "And the big secret: those competitors they are copying are dead broke. So why on earth copy them?"
> -- Chapter 5

---

## AP-002: Never Race to the Bottom on Price
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 0-foundational

> "Getting people to buy is NOT the objective of a business. Making money is. And lowering price is a one-way road to destruction for most -- you can only go down to $0, but you can go infinitely high in the other direction."
> -- Chapter 5

---

## AP-003: Never Niche-Hop
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 2-strategic

> "If you keep hopping from niche to niche, hoping that the market will solve your problems, you deserve to be niche slapped."
> -- Chapter 4

> "You will fail. In fact, you will fail until you succeed. But you will fail far longer if you keep changing who you market to, because you must start over from the beginning each time."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## AP-004: Never Sell to People Without Purchasing Power
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 2-strategic

Resume-writing service example: targeting unemployed people who are in pain but cannot pay.

> "Your audience needs to be able to afford the service you're charging them for."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## AP-005: Never Sell to a Shrinking Market
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 2-strategic

Lloyd's newspaper software: great product, great offer, great sales skills -- but the market was shrinking 25% per year.

> "Same entrepreneur. Different market. He applied his same skill set to a business he had zero experience in and was able to win. That's the power of picking the right market."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## AP-006: Never Focus Only on Dream Outcome Claims
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 2-strategic

Beginner marketers make bigger and bigger promises (top of value equation). This is easy and lazy. Anyone can make a promise.

> "In the beginning of my career, I focused all my attention on dream outcomes and the perception of achievement... that's where beginner marketers make bigger and bigger claims. It's easy, and it's lazy."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## AP-007: Never Be Romantic About Your Solution Method
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 3-tactical

Hormozi lost sales by insisting clients never eat out. Only when he was desperate for rent money did he concede and create an eating-out guide -- which became a permanent sales tool.

> "Don't get romantic about how you want to solve the problem. Find a way to solve every problem a prospect presents with."
> -- Chapter 10

---

## AP-008: Never Charge More Than Value Delivered
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 0-foundational

> "Yes, you should never charge more than your product is worth. But you should charge far more for your product and services than it costs to fulfill it. Think up to a hundred times more, not just two or three times more."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## AP-009: Never Personalize Offer Failure
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 2-strategic

> "Stop personalizing! It's not about you! If your offer doesn't work, it doesn't mean you suck. It means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## AP-010: Never Optimize Before You Have Cash Flow
**Tag:** ANTI_PATTERN | Layer: 2-strategic

> "I'd rather do more for every customer and have cash flow coming in, then optimize my business but have zero cash flow coming in after (and zero idea about what I need to adjust to better serve my customers)."
> -- Chapter 10

# 5. CONCRETE EXAMPLES

## EX-001: The Gym Launch Origin Story
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Grand Slam Offer saving a business from bankruptcy; conviction + offer > all other factors

Hormozi had $1,036 in his account. He went into debt at $3,300/day on a credit card to launch six gyms simultaneously. The Grand Slam Offer worked: $100,117 in the first month, $1.5M+/mo within 12 months, $4.4M/mo within 24 months, $120M+ in cumulative sales within another 24 months.

> "I had two things left at that point: a grand slam offer and an old business credit card with a $100,000 limit."
> -- Chapter 1

**Why it works:** This demonstrates that the OFFER is the fundamental leverage point. Same entrepreneur, same market, same skills -- the offer was the variable that changed everything.

---

## EX-002: Commoditized Agency vs. Grand Slam Agency
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** The 22.4x multiplier effect of a Grand Slam Offer; F-010

**Old way (commoditized):** "$1,000 down, then $1,000/mo retainer for agency services"
- Same ad spend, fewer responses, lower close rate, lower price
- Result: lose money acquiring customers, break even in month 2, profit in month 3

**New way (Grand Slam Offer):** "Pay one time. No recurring fee. No retainer. Just cover ad spend. I'll generate leads and work your leads for you. And only pay me if people show up. And I'll guarantee you get 20 people in your first month, or you get your next month free. I'll also provide all the best practices from the other businesses like yours."
- Same ad spend, 2.5x more responses, 2.5x higher close rate, 4x higher price
- Result: $112,000 collected from $10,000 ad spend

> "2.5 x 2.5 x 4 = 22.4x more cash collected up front."
> -- Chapter 3

**Why it works:** Identical fulfillment effort, completely different offer structure, 22.4x revenue difference.

---

## EX-003: Niche Pricing -- Time Management Course
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-008, the 100x niche pricing rule

- "Time Management" -- $19
- "Time Management for Sales Professionals" -- $99
- "Time Management for B2B Outbound Sales Reps" -- $499
- "Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools & Gardening Sales Reps" -- $1,000-$2,000

> "The actual pieces of the program may be the same as the generic $19 course, but since they have been applied, and the sales messaging could speak so much to this avatar, they will find it more compelling and get more value from it in a real way."
> -- Chapter 4

**Why it works:** Specificity creates the perception "this was made exactly for me" which increases both perceived likelihood of achievement AND willingness to pay.

---

## EX-004: Fitness Program Generic vs. Niche
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-008

> "That's why a fitness program for generic weight loss might be priced at only $19 while a fitness program designed and marketed only to shift-nurses might be priced at $1997... (even though the core of the program is likely similar - eat less, move more)."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## EX-005: Wine Pricing Study
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-021, price literally creates perceived value

Researchers gave participants the same wine three times labeled as low, medium, and high-priced. Participants rated the "expensive" wine as significantly better than the "cheap" wine despite them being identical.

> -- Chapter 5

**Why it works:** Price IS a value signal. Higher price triggers the assumption of higher quality, creating a self-fulfilling perception loop.

## EX-006: Meditation vs. Xanax (Value Equation Applied)
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** F-001, the Value Equation in action; P-007

Both offer the same dream outcome: relaxation, decreased anxiety, feelings of well-being.

**Meditation:** Low perceived likelihood of achievement, high time delay, high effort & sacrifice
**Xanax:** High perceived likelihood, near-zero time delay, near-zero effort

> "And that is why Xanax is a multi-billion dollar product while I know of almost no multi-billion dollar meditation businesses... value."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## EX-007: Supplements vs. Gym Memberships
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** F-001, P-007

Same perceived outcomes ("being healthy," "losing weight," "looking good"). Supplement industry ($123B) is 2x the gym industry ($62B).

> "People are more willing to pay $200 for supplements than they are a $29/mo membership. Taking a pill, or drinking a shake, is so much faster and easier than going to the gym everyday."
> -- Chapter 6

**Why it works:** Lower effort/sacrifice and lower time delay = higher perceived value, even if the actual outcome is inferior.

---

## EX-008: Fitness vs. Liposuction
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** F-001, all four value drivers compared

Same dream outcome (look great). Fitness: months of time, tons of effort, uncertain results. Liposuction: one afternoon, zero effort after, near-certain results.

> "This is why when you sell fitness, you have to spend an hour arm-wrestling a client to give over 1/10th to 1/100th of the amount of money they pay for surgery."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## EX-009: Gym Launch Premium Pricing
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-009, DR-024, the virtuous cycle of price

Hormozi entered a market where competitors charged $500/mo (low end) to $5,000 (high end). He priced at $16,000 for a 16-week program, then upsold 35% to $42,000/year. He was selling to gym owners who averaged $35,280/year in take-home pay.

Average results for clients after 11 months:
- +$239,000/year top line revenue
- +$160,068/year recurring revenue
- 3.1x bottom line profit increase

> "I knew it worked. I had outworked my self-doubt."
> -- Chapter 5

---

## EX-010: Photography Business 5x Price Increase
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** F-001, the power of value creation on price and profit

Average ticket: $300 -> $1,500 (5x increase). Profit: $1,000/week -> $38,000/week (38x increase). Less time per customer, higher satisfaction.

> "But none of that would have been possible without figuring out what people valued most, tripling down on it, and ruthlessly eliminating everything else."
> -- Chapter 6

---

## EX-011: The Dad Phone Call (Value Equation in Conversation)
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** F-011, the four value equation questions naturally asked by prospects

Hormozi's father questioned whether his $42,000 service was "legal." Hormozi walked him through:
- "If I made you $239,000 extra this year, would you pay me $42,000?" (Dream Outcome)
- "About 15 hours a week of work" (Effort)
- "Eleven months" (Time Delay)
- "Nothing. Just pay me as you start making the money" (Likelihood / Risk Removal)

> "I watched it click. My dad got it."
> -- Chapter 5

## EX-012: Lloyd -- Newspapers to Masks
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-005 (all four market indicators), AP-005

Lloyd: smart entrepreneur, great product, great offer, natural salesman. Failed in newspapers (shrinking 25%/year). Pivoted to automated mask manufacturing during COVID. Millions per month within five months.

> "Same entrepreneur. Different market."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## EX-013: The Eating Out Guide (Solve Every Problem)
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-014, AP-007

Hormozi lost sales because he refused to help clients who ate out at restaurants. When desperate for rent money, he finally solved the problem by creating an eating-out guide. It became a permanent sales tool that eliminated a recurring objection.

> "Refusing to lose the sale because of this one thing, I conceded 'I'll make you an eating out guide for when you go to restaurants so you can eat out 100 percent of the time and still hit your goal.'"
> -- Chapter 10

---

## EX-014: Gym Launch Done-For-You to Done-With-You Transition
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-015 (sales-fulfillment continuum)

Phase 1 (DFY): Flew to gyms, spent own money on hotels/cars/ads, generated leads, worked leads, sold for them, onboarded clients. Made ~$100,000/mo personally. Scaled to 8 gyms/month.

Phase 2 (DWY): Taught gym owners to do what he did. Charged ~1/3 the price. Helped hundreds of gyms per month from home.

> "My promise was fundamentally the same: I will fill your gym in 30 days. It was simply the how and what I did that changed."
> -- Chapter 10

---

## EX-015: The Excel Meal Plan Tool
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** P-013, one-time creation / infinite delivery

Hormozi spent ~100 hours building an Excel application that auto-generated 100+ personalized meals based on macronutrient needs, plus grocery lists and prep instructions. After creation, each plan took ~15 minutes to produce.

> "High value. Low cost."
> -- Chapter 10

---

## EX-016: Arnold Schwarzenegger Fundraiser
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** P-011, scarcity + urgency + bonuses in action

$15,000 tickets raised to $25,000 with fewer seats (100 total). Raised $5,400,000 ($54,000 per head). One-of-a-kind auction items. Bonuses added during bidding to increase prices.

> "The products remained unchanged, yet within this setting, an item that wouldn't sell at a different venue for $10,000 sold for $100,000."
> -- Chapter 11

---

## EX-017: The Hot Dog Stand Parable
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-004, starving crowd principle

> "A marketing professor asked his students, 'If you were going to open a hotdog stand, and you could only have one advantage over your competitors... which would it be...?' The students kept going until eventually they had run out of answers... The professor smiled and replied, 'A starving crowd.'"
> -- Chapter 4

---

## EX-018: COVID Toilet Paper
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-004, extreme demand overrides all other factors

> "There was no offer. The pricing was atrocious. And there was no compelling sales pitch. But because the crowd was so big and so starving, rolls of toilet paper were going for $100 or more."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## EX-019: The Resume Writer Targeting Unemployed People
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** AP-004

> "He thought, 'These people are easy to target. They're in massive pain. There are plenty of them, and it's constantly adding new people. This is a great market!' He just forgot a crucial point: your audience needs to be able to afford the service you're charging them for."
> -- Chapter 4

---

## EX-020: The Weight Loss Challenge Offer (Step 1)
**Tag:** EXAMPLE | Layer: 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** F-004 Step 1 + Step 2, the problem listing process

Before: selling $99/mo bootcamp memberships. Prospects compared to $29/mo LA Fitness. Couldn't even give it away free.

After: "Lose 20lbs in 6 weeks" -- a challenge offer.
- Big dream outcome: lose 20lbs
- Decreased time delay: 6 weeks

Then listed 16+ core problems with 32-64 sub-problems across four value driver categories.

> "What I showed here isn't just four problems, though. We have 16 core problems with two to four sub problems underneath. So 32 to 64 problems total."

# 6. AGENT INSTRUCTIONS (Synthesis)

## AI-001: Offer Construction Decision Tree

```
START: Define the market
  |
  +--> Does the market have all 4 indicators? (Pain, Purchasing Power, Easy to Target, Growing)
  |     NO --> Find a different market or sub-segment
  |     YES --> Continue
  |
  +--> Is the market in Health, Wealth, or Relationships?
  |     NO --> Connect your offer to one of these three
  |     YES --> Continue
  |
  +--> Define the niche avatar (specific person, specific problem, specific situation)
  |
  +--> Step 1: Define Dream Outcome (the destination, not the vehicle)
  |     - What does the prospect's life look like AFTER?
  |     - What status gain do they achieve?
  |     - Frame as the vacation, not the plane flight
  |
  +--> Step 2: List ALL Problems (minimum 16 core problems, 32+ sub-problems)
  |     For each core activity the prospect must do:
  |       - What makes it hard/confusing? (Effort)
  |       - What makes it take too long? (Time)
  |       - What makes it not worth it financially? (Dream Outcome)
  |       - What makes them doubt it will work for them? (Likelihood)
  |       - What happens when they travel/have family conflicts/edge cases? (Sustainability)
  |
  +--> Step 3: Convert each problem to a solution
  |     Template: "How to [reverse the problem]"
  |
  +--> Step 4: Create delivery vehicles for each solution
  |     Use cheat codes: 1:1 vs small group vs 1:many
  |     DIY vs DWY vs DFY
  |     Live vs recorded; medium; response time
  |     Apply 10x/1-10th test
  |
  +--> Step 5a: TRIM
  |     Remove: high cost + low value (first)
  |     Remove: low cost + low value (second)
  |     Keep: low cost + high value; high cost + high value
  |
  +--> Step 5b: STACK & NAME
  |     Bundle remaining items
  |     Give each bundle a sexy name
  |     Assign a dollar value to each
  |     Sum total value, present actual price as fraction
  |
  +--> ENHANCE (Chapters 11-16, Part 2)
        Add: Scarcity, Urgency, Bonuses, Guarantees, Naming
```

## AI-002: Pre-Writing Checklist for Offer Copy

Before writing ANY offer copy (landing page, sales page, VSL script, email sequence), verify:

### Market Validation
- [ ] Market has massive pain (desperate need, not mild want)
- [ ] Market has purchasing power (can afford the price point)
- [ ] Market is easy to target (known channels, groups, lists)
- [ ] Market is growing (not shrinking)
- [ ] Niche is specific enough (can describe exact avatar in one sentence)

### Offer Structure
- [ ] Dream outcome is defined as the DESTINATION, not the mechanism
- [ ] Dream outcome connects to status gain
- [ ] All major obstacles/problems have been listed (minimum 16)
- [ ] Every problem has been converted to a solution
- [ ] Delivery vehicles chosen for each solution
- [ ] High-cost/low-value items trimmed
- [ ] Remaining items bundled and named
- [ ] Total value calculated and presented as >> price

### Value Equation Check
- [ ] Dream outcome clearly articulated (what they GET)
- [ ] Perceived likelihood of achievement supported (proof, testimonials, guarantees)
- [ ] Time delay minimized or fast wins included
- [ ] Effort & sacrifice minimized or eliminated where possible
- [ ] Bottom of equation (time + effort) addressed, not just top (outcome + likelihood)

### Pricing Check
- [ ] Price is premium (not matching competitors)
- [ ] Price creates a value gap (value >> price, like $100K value for $10K)
- [ ] Price is high enough to create emotional investment
- [ ] Price is justified through the stacked value presentation

### Differentiation Check
- [ ] Offer cannot be directly compared to any competitor's offer
- [ ] Offer forces a value-based (not price-based) decision
- [ ] Prospect's only comparison is "this offer vs. nothing"

### Copy Mechanics
- [ ] Pain articulated from prospect's perspective (they feel understood)
- [ ] Benefits framed in terms of status gained (as perceived by others)
- [ ] Short-term wins included alongside long-term dream outcome
- [ ] Every known objection addressed within the offer itself

---

## AI-003: Offer Rules Ranked by Importance

1. **Market first.** No offer can save a bad market. Verify the four indicators before writing anything.
2. **Sell the dream outcome, not the process.** Never describe the vehicle; describe the destination.
3. **Create a category of one.** The offer must be incomparable to anything else available.
4. **Charge premium.** Price creates value. The virtuous cycle only works at premium prices.
5. **Solve every problem.** Each unsolved obstacle is a lost sale. Leave no objection unaddressed.
6. **Decrease the bottom of the value equation.** Reduce time delay and effort/sacrifice -- this is harder and more valuable than inflating dream outcomes.
7. **Stack and name value.** Bundle solutions with sexy names and assigned dollar values. Total value must dramatically exceed price.
8. **Make the prospect feel understood.** Articulate their pain accurately. The pain is the pitch.
9. **Frame benefits as status gains.** Show how others will perceive their achievement.
10. **Include fast wins.** Create early emotional reinforcement to sustain engagement.
11. **Never compete on price.** If you're the second cheapest, you're in the worst strategic position.
12. **Commit to the niche.** Pick one. Try 100 offers before switching.

## AI-004: Copy Pattern Templates (Derived from Hormozi's Examples)

### Pattern A: The Grand Slam Offer Pitch Structure
```
[Pay structure that removes risk] +
[Core delivery promise] +
[Guarantee that reverses risk] +
[Bonus stack of supporting systems/tools] +
[Social proof / best practices from others like them]
```

Example:
> "Pay one time. (No recurring fee. No retainer.) Just cover ad spend. I'll generate leads and work your leads for you. And only pay me if people show up. And I'll guarantee you get 20 people in your first month, or you get your next month free. I'll also provide all the best practices from the other businesses like yours."

### Pattern B: The Value Stack Presentation
```
[Problem] -> [Sexy Solution Name]... [benefit statement] ($[value] value)
  - Component 1
  - Component 2
  - Component 3

[Next Problem] -> [Sexy Solution Name]... [benefit statement] ($[value] value)
  - Component 1
  - Component 2

...

Total value: $[sum] -- All for only $[price].
```

### Pattern C: The "How To" Solution Reversal
```
Problem: "[Activity] is [negative adjective]"
Solution: "How to [activity] [positive outcome], so that [anyone/even specific avatar] can [benefit]"
```

### Pattern D: The Conviction Close (from the Dad conversation)
```
"If I [specific measurable outcome] for you, would you pay me $[price]?"
"And what if you only had to [specific effort level]?"
"And it took [specific timeframe]?"
"And you didn't have to pay until [risk-reversal condition]?"
```

### Pattern E: The Status Benefit Frame
```
[Direct benefit statement]. [How others will perceive/react to the prospect's achievement]... [they'll wonder what changed]... [only you will know].
```

## AI-006: Value Equation Quick-Reference for Copy Review

When reviewing ANY piece of offer copy, score it against the Value Equation:

| Driver | Question to Ask | What to Look For in Copy |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Dream Outcome | Is the destination clearly painted? | Specific, measurable outcome + status gain |
| Perceived Likelihood | Does the prospect believe THIS will work for THEM? | Proof, testimonials, guarantees, track record, specificity to their situation |
| Time Delay | How fast do they get results? | Speed claims, fast wins, immediate value, timeline promises |
| Effort & Sacrifice | How easy is this for them? | Done-for-you elements, simplicity claims, removal of friction, convenience |

**Scoring:**
- If Dream Outcome is vague or generic --> REWRITE
- If Likelihood has no proof elements --> ADD social proof, guarantee, or specificity
- If Time Delay is not addressed --> ADD speed promise or fast-win milestone
- If Effort is not minimized --> ADD done-for-you elements or simplify the ask

**The infinite value test:** Could you make the bottom of the equation approach zero? What would that look like?
