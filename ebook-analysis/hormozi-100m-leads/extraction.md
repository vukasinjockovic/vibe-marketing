## DECISION RULES

### DR-01: Core Four Selection
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF you need to reach people who already know you, AND you want 1-to-1 contact → THEN use Warm Outreach.
IF you need to reach people who already know you, AND you want 1-to-many contact → THEN Post Free Content.
IF you need to reach strangers, AND you want 1-to-1 contact → THEN use Cold Outreach.
IF you need to reach strangers, AND you want 1-to-many contact → THEN Run Paid Ads.
> "There are only four ways to let people know about the stuff you sell." -- Section II Intro

### DR-02: Lead Magnet Problem Selection
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF selecting a problem for a lead magnet → THEN pick a problem that is (1) meaningful and (2) narrow enough to solve completely.
> "Narrow your problem. Then narrow it again." -- Lead Magnets Ch.
IF the lead magnet solves a problem that is too broad → THEN it cannot deliver a complete solution and fails.
IF the lead magnet solves a problem that is too narrow to be meaningful → THEN nobody cares enough to opt in.

### DR-03: Lead Magnet Type Selection
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF your audience does not know they have a problem → THEN use a "Reveal the Problem" lead magnet (diagnose/assess).
IF your audience knows the problem but wants proof your solution works → THEN use a "Sample or Trial" lead magnet (free trial, demo, free session).
IF your audience knows the solution but wants help with the first step → THEN use a "One Step of a Multi-Step Process" lead magnet (first step free).
> "Three broad types of lead magnets: 1) Reveal problems they didn't know they had. 2) Samples & trials. 3) One step of a multi-step process." -- Lead Magnets Ch.

### DR-04: Lead Magnet Delivery Vehicle
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF delivering a lead magnet → THEN choose from: Software, Information, Services, or Physical Products.
IF you want lowest cost at scale → THEN use Software or Information.
IF you want highest perceived value → THEN use Services or Physical Products.
IF you want maximum scalability → THEN use Software (one-time creation, infinite delivery).

### DR-05: Content Give:Ask Ratio
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF posting free content → THEN maintain a minimum 3:1 give-to-ask ratio (3 give posts for every 1 ask post).
IF possible → THEN aim for a higher ratio. Ideal: "Give until they ask."
> "Give give give give give give give ask. That's the cadence." -- Content Ch.

### DR-06: Content Unit Structure
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF creating any piece of content → THEN structure it as: Hook (get attention) + Retain (keep attention) + Reward (deliver value).
IF the hook fails → THEN nothing else matters; nobody sees the content.
IF the reward is weak → THEN audience does not come back for more.
> "Every unit of content, no matter how long or short, has three elements: Hook, Retain, Reward." -- Content Ch.

### DR-07: Warm Outreach Script Selection
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 4-specific
IF reaching out to a warm contact about your offer → THEN use the indirect referral frame: "Do you know anyone who [desires outcome]?"
IF they say "Actually, I might be interested" → THEN proceed with the value pitch.
IF they say "Let me think about it" → THEN they have an unsolved concern. Find and address it.
> "Hey [Name], I'm doing something kind of cool. Do you know anyone who would be interested in [free/discounted service that solves specific problem]?" -- Warm Outreach Ch.

### DR-08: ACA Framework for Warm Outreach
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF initiating warm outreach → THEN use ACA: Acknowledge (their last message/post), Compliment (something genuine), Ask (your question about referrals).
IF you skip the Acknowledge and Compliment → THEN the contact feels used and the ask falls flat.
> "ACA stands for Acknowledge, Compliment, Ask. In that order." -- Warm Outreach Ch.

### DR-09: Cold Outreach Personalization Rule
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF doing cold outreach → THEN personalize every message. Use their name, reference something specific about them, make it clear this is not a mass blast.
IF sending identical messages to everyone → THEN response rates collapse to near zero.
> "Personalization is the key to cold outreach... Big fast value is the other key." -- Cold Outreach Ch.

### DR-10: Cold Outreach Value-First Rule
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF doing cold outreach → THEN lead with Big Fast Value. Offer something valuable for free before asking for anything.
IF you lead with a pitch → THEN you get ignored.
> "Big fast value means you provide something valuable, for free, as fast as possible." -- Cold Outreach Ch.

### DR-11: Cold Outreach Volume Rule
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF cold outreach is not working → THEN first check volume before changing the approach.
IF sending fewer than 100 outreaches per day → THEN you do not have enough data to know if it works.
> "100 per day, not 100 over time." -- Section V

### DR-12: Paid Ad Structure
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF writing a paid ad → THEN structure it as: Callout (who is this for) + Value (what do they get) + CTA (what do they do next).
> "Every ad has three parts: a callout, value, and a call to action." -- Paid Ads Ch.

### DR-13: Callout Type Selection
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF calling out your audience verbally → THEN use one of: Labels ("Attention gym owners"), Yes-Questions ("Do you struggle with...?"), or If-Then Statements ("If you [situation], then [promise]").
IF calling out your audience visually → THEN use: Contrast (stand out from surroundings), Likeness (look like the audience), or Scene (show the desired outcome).
> "We call people out with words, images, or both." -- Paid Ads Ch.

### DR-14: Ad Value Delivery via What-Who-When
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF writing the value section of an ad → THEN use the What-Who-When framework:
- WHAT: 8 value elements (4 drivers from Value Equation + 4 opposites)
- WHO: Present the outcome through different perspectives (spouse, kids, boss, rivals, friends)
- WHEN: Frame the benefit across past, present, and future timelines
> "What-Who-When gives you hundreds of ad angles from a single offer." -- Paid Ads Ch.

### DR-15: CTA Structure
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF writing a CTA → THEN tell them exactly what to do AND give them reasons to do it now.
IF the CTA lacks specificity → THEN conversion drops.
IF the CTA lacks urgency reasons → THEN they delay and never return.
> "Tell them what to do. Tell them reasons to do it now." -- Paid Ads Ch.

### DR-16: More Better New Sequence
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF you want more engaged leads → THEN follow this exact sequence: (1) Do MORE of what is already working, (2) Make it BETTER by testing improvements, (3) Only then try something NEW.
IF you skip to "new" before maximizing "more" and "better" → THEN you leave massive results on the table.
> "More, better, new. In that order. Always." -- Maximizing Ch.

### DR-17: Rule of 100
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF starting any advertising method → THEN commit to 100 primary actions per day for 100 days before judging results.
IF doing warm/cold outreach → THEN 100 reaches per day.
IF posting content → THEN 100 minutes of content creation per day.
IF running paid ads → THEN $100/day in ad spend.
> "If you do 100 primary actions every day for 100 straight days, you will not be in the same place." -- Maximizing Ch.

### DR-18: Constraint Identification
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF advertising is not producing enough leads → THEN find the constraint (the step with the biggest drop-off) and fix ONLY that.
IF you fix something that is not the constraint → THEN total output does not change.
> "Find the constraint. It's where the biggest drop-off happens. Fix that and only that." -- Maximizing Ch.

### DR-19: Testing Protocol
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF testing advertising improvements → THEN test one variable per week per platform.
IF you change multiple variables simultaneously → THEN you cannot attribute results.
IF a test wins → THEN it becomes the new control. Log results.
> "One test per week. One variable. That's it." -- Maximizing Ch.

### DR-20: Referral Trigger
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF you want more customer referrals → THEN first ensure your product creates maximum goodwill (Goodwill = Value delivered - Price charged).
IF goodwill is low → THEN no referral program will work. Fix the product first.
> "Goodwill is the gap between what you charge and what you deliver. The bigger the gap, the more they tell others." -- Referrals Ch.

### DR-21: Referral Ask Timing
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF asking for referrals → THEN ask at the peak emotional moment (at point of purchase or at point of first result).
IF asking at random times → THEN conversion drops dramatically.

### DR-22: Employee Training Method
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF training employees to advertise → THEN use the 3Ds: (1) Document (create checklist), (2) Demonstrate (do it in front of them), (3) Duplicate (they do it in front of you).
IF you skip Documentation → THEN knowledge stays in your head and cannot scale.
IF you skip Demonstration → THEN they misinterpret the checklist.
IF you skip Duplication → THEN you do not know if they can actually do it.
> "Document, demonstrate, duplicate. In that order." -- Employees Ch.

### DR-23: Agency Usage Strategy
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF hiring an agency → THEN treat it as a learning arrangement, not permanent outsourcing.
IF you outsource permanently → THEN you never own the skill and remain dependent.

> "Use agencies to learn skills you keep forever." -- Agencies Ch.

### DR-24: Affiliate Launch Method
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF launching an affiliate program → THEN use Whisper-Tease-Shout: (1) Whisper (behind-the-scenes curiosity), (2) Tease (reveal value elements), (3) Shout (CTA with urgency/scarcity).
> "Whisper, tease, shout. That's how you launch affiliates." -- Affiliates Ch.

### DR-25: Open to Goal Work Schedule
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF you have a daily lead target → THEN work "open to goal" -- do not stop until the goal is hit, regardless of hours.
IF you use time-based work instead → THEN effort becomes the metric instead of results.
> "You don't just commit to doing something a specific number of times...you commit to the work until you hit a specific number of outcomes--no matter what." -- Section V

### DR-26: Advertising Budget Testing
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF running paid ads → THEN set aside 1-10% of advertising budget for testing new campaigns, channels, and ideas without expecting a return.
> "Whether it's 1%, 5%, or 10%, set some percentage of your advertising budget aside to try new things without expecting a return. Consider it an investment in your education." -- Section V

### DR-27: Platform Scaling Sequence
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF scaling advertising → THEN follow this sequence: (1) Master one platform first, (2) Expand to new audiences on that platform, (3) Use all placements and media types on that platform, (4) Only then add a new platform.
IF you spread across platforms too early → THEN you master none.

### DR-28: Lead Magnet Naming
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF naming a lead magnet → THEN use the formula: [Dream Outcome] + [specific result] + [timeframe if applicable] + [who it is for].
IF the name does not clearly communicate the dream outcome → THEN opt-in rates suffer.

### DR-29: Paid Ads Money Phases
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF starting paid ads → THEN expect three phases: (1) Track Money (learn what works, measure everything), (2) Lose Money (test at scale, expect losses while learning), (3) Print Money (scale what works).
IF you quit during the "Lose Money" phase → THEN you never reach profitability.
> "Everyone goes through these three phases: track, lose, print." -- Paid Ads Ch.

### DR-30: Client Financed Acquisition
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF your business model allows it → THEN structure your offers so that the revenue from new customers within 30 days covers the cost of acquiring them.
IF acquisition is not self-financing within 30 days → THEN growth requires external capital and creates cash crunches.
> "Client financed acquisition means you break even on customer acquisition within 30 days." -- Paid Ads Ch.

### DR-31: LTGP:CAC Ratio
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF evaluating advertising profitability → THEN maintain a minimum 3:1 ratio of Lifetime Gross Profit to Customer Acquisition Cost.
IF the ratio drops below 3:1 → THEN the advertising channel is unprofitable or the offer needs work.
> "LTGP to CAC. Three to one or better." -- Paid Ads Ch.

### DR-32: Lead Magnet Quality Standard
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
IF creating a lead magnet → THEN make it so good that people feel guilty for not paying.
> "Give away the secrets, sell the implementation." -- Lead Magnets Ch.

### DR-33: Nine-Word Email for Re-Engagement
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 4-specific
IF re-engaging cold or dormant leads → THEN use Dean Jackson's 9-word email: "Are you still looking to [4-word desire]?"
IF using a long re-engagement email → THEN it gets ignored. Shorter is better.
> "The nine-word email. Nine words. That's it." -- Warm Outreach Ch.

### DR-34: Headline Component Selection
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF writing a headline or hook → THEN include one or more of these 7 components: Recency, Relevancy, Celebrity, Proximity, Conflict, Unusual, Ongoing.
IF the headline has none of these → THEN it fails to grab attention.

### DR-35: Retention Structure Selection
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF structuring content for retention → THEN use one of: Lists (numbered/bulleted), Steps (sequential process), or Stories (narrative with curiosity).

IF using steps → THEN they create "what comes next?" anticipation.
IF using stories → THEN they create emotional investment.

### DR-36: Seven Ways to Ask for Referrals
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF asking for referrals → THEN select from these seven methods:
1. One-sided benefit: Reward only the referrer
2. Two-sided benefit: Reward both referrer and referred
3. Ask at purchase: Request referrals at the moment of buying
4. Negotiation chip: "I'll give you X if you refer Y people"
5. Referral events: Host events where customers bring friends
6. Ongoing programs: Continuous reward structure
7. Unlockable bonuses: Referrals unlock additional benefits

### DR-37: Six Ways to Get Referrals by Increasing Value
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF you want organic referrals without asking → THEN maximize goodwill through these six methods:
1. Sell better customers (who get better results)
2. Set better expectations (so results exceed expectations)
3. Get more people better results (improve success rate)
4. Deliver faster wins (speed to first result)
5. Keep improving the product (continuous improvement)
6. Tell them what to buy next (guide their journey)

### DR-38: Affiliate Integration Strategy
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
IF integrating affiliates → THEN choose from three strategies:
1. Give away your lead magnet for free (affiliates distribute it)
2. Sell your lead magnet (affiliates earn commission)
3. Sell your core offer directly (affiliates get higher commission)
IF starting → THEN begin with strategy 1 (lowest friction).

### DR-39: Volume Diagnostic
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
IF advertising is not working → THEN FIRST diagnose volume before changing strategy.
IF you are doing less than 100 primary actions per day → THEN effort is the problem, not the method.
> "Most people dramatically underestimate the volume it takes to make advertising work. They're not doing half as much or a third as much as is required. In fact, they're doing dramatically less." -- Section V

### DR-40: Scaling Roadmap
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
IF scaling from zero → THEN follow these levels in order:
- Level 1: Warm outreach (friends know about your stuff)
- Level 2: Warm outreach + free content (consistent personal advertising)
- Level 3: Hire employees to help advertise
- Level 4: Product good enough for consistent referrals (25%+)
- Level 5: Multiple methods on multiple platforms
- Level 6: Executive-led departments per channel
> "These levels will help you identify where you are on the advertising totem pole so you know what to do to get to the next level." -- Section V

## PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### P-01: Leads Are People
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational
A lead is "a person you can contact." An engaged lead is "a person who shows interest in the stuff you sell." All advertising effort aims to turn leads into engaged leads and engaged leads into customers.
> "A lead is a person you can contact. An engaged lead is a person who has shown interest in the stuff you sell."

### P-02: Only Four Ways to Advertise
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
There are only four ways to let people know about what you sell. Every advertising activity in history is a variation of the Core Four: Warm Outreach, Post Free Content, Cold Outreach, Run Paid Ads.
> "There have only ever been four ways to let other people know about the stuff you sell."

### P-03: Advertising Always Works
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational
Advertising always works. It is only a question of efficiency. If you let more people know about your stuff, more people will buy it. Period.
> "Advertising always works, it's only a matter of efficiency. So once you start, keep going until it works."

### P-04: Volume Is the Prerequisite
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational
Most people dramatically underestimate the volume required for advertising to work. They are not doing half or a third of what is needed -- they are doing 1/100th or 1/1000th of what is required. Volume is always the first diagnostic.
> "Most people dramatically underestimate the volume it takes to make advertising work."

### P-05: Give Away the Secrets, Sell the Implementation
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
The best lead magnets give away the actual knowledge for free. People pay for convenience, speed, and someone doing it for them -- not for the information itself.
> "Give away the secrets, sell the implementation."

### P-06: Compounding Through People
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
There are two ways to build a compounding business: (1) Find people who never stop buying your stuff (customers via referrals), or (2) Find people who never stop selling for you (affiliates/employees). Both create exponential growth.
> "There are two ways to create a compounding business. You can find more people that never stop buying your stuff or you can find more people who never stop selling it for you."

### P-07: Goodwill Drives Word of Mouth
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
Goodwill is the gap between value delivered and price charged. The larger this gap, the more organic word-of-mouth you generate. No referral program can overcome low goodwill.
> "Goodwill equals value minus price. The bigger the gap, the more they tell others."

### P-08: Engaged Leads vs. Leads
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
There is a critical difference between a lead (contact information) and an engaged lead (someone who has shown active interest). All lead generation effort should focus on engaged leads.

### P-09: The Value Equation (from $100M Offers)
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
```
Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)
```
This equation from the prior book underpins all offer/lead magnet construction in this book.

### P-10: Permission Over Interruption
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
Warm outreach and free content build permission. Cold outreach and paid ads are interruptions. Permission-based methods (warm) have higher conversion rates but smaller reach. Interruption-based methods (cold/paid) have lower conversion but unlimited reach.

### P-11: Advertising is an Inputs and Outputs Game
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational
You input advertising effort. Your output is engaged leads. The relationship is direct. More inputs always produce more outputs.
> "To them, outputs appear out of their control. Their low effort inputs get them their low and unreliable output of engaged leads."

### P-12: You Either Win or You Learn
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational
Every advertising attempt either produces results (win) or produces data (learning). Neither is wasted. The only failure is quitting.
> "You either win or you learn."

### P-13: The Many-Sided Die
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 0-foundational
Advertising is like rolling a many-sided die. You do not know how many sides your die has. Each green roll makes the next green more likely. Each roll teaches you something. The only way to lose is to stop rolling.
> "Every die hits its green streak when rolled enough times."

### P-14: Speed of Learning = Speed of Earning
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational
Your speed to making big money depends on how fast you learn the skills to making big money. Advertising skill compounds with practice.
> "Your speed to making big money depends on how fast you learn the skills to making big money."

### P-15: Lead Getters Scale Beyond You
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
You can either do the advertising yourself or get other people to do it. There are more "other people" than there are of you. Scaling requires lead getters (customers who refer, employees, agencies, affiliates).
> "You can either do the advertising or other people can. And there are more 'other people' than there are of you."

## ANTI-PATTERNS & WARNINGS

### AP-01: Volume Deficit Misdiagnosed as Method Failure
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
Doing 300 flyers when 5,000/day is the minimum viable test size, then concluding "flyers don't work."
> "I was doing 1/1500th the level of effort required to make a flyer campaign work -- I just didn't know it."

### AP-02: Quitting During the "Lose Money" Phase
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic
Stopping paid ads when initial campaigns are unprofitable, before testing enough to find a winner. Everyone goes through Track Money -> Lose Money -> Print Money.

### AP-03: Spreading Across Platforms Too Early
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic
Starting multiple platforms before mastering one. Master one platform completely, then expand.

### AP-04: Doing "More" Before "Better" on a Broken Process
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic
Scaling volume on an unconverted process (low conversion rate). First make it better (find constraint, fix it), then do more.
BUT: Volume is almost always the problem first. Check volume before checking conversion.

### AP-05: Changing Strategy Instead of Increasing Volume
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
"I tried cold outreach for two weeks and it didn't work, so I'm switching to paid ads." Problem: they tried 100 total outreaches, not 100 per day.

### AP-06: Mass Blasting Cold Outreach
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical
Sending identical cold messages to everyone. Personalization is the difference between 0% and meaningful response rates.

### AP-07: Pitching Before Providing Value
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic
Leading with a sales pitch in cold outreach instead of leading with Big Fast Value. Must give before you ask.

### AP-08: Asking for the Sale Too Soon in Warm Outreach
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical
"Hey, I have this thing, want to buy it?" instead of ACA framework with indirect referral ask.

### AP-09: Low Give:Ask Ratio
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic
Asking for sales every other post. Minimum 3:1 give-to-ask. The audience burns out and unfollows.

### AP-10: Hook-Only Content
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical
Creating content with strong hooks but weak rewards. Gets initial views but people don't return.

### AP-11: Permanent Agency Dependency
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic
Using agencies as permanent outsources instead of learning arrangements. You never own the skill.

### AP-12: Skipping Product Quality for Referral Programs
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic
Building referral programs before ensuring the product creates sufficient goodwill. No program can overcome a bad product.

### AP-13: Expecting Overnight Results
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 0-foundational
Expecting to crack a new lead source in days or weeks. Hormozi expects 3-6 months to crack a new lead source.
> "I expect to crack a new lead source in three to six months (and this isn't my first rodeo). So if your expectations are faster than that, do you think your expectations are reasonable?"

### AP-14: Testing Multiple Variables Simultaneously
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical
Changing headline, image, and audience in the same test. Cannot attribute results. One variable per test per week.

### AP-15: Not Tracking or Logging Tests
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical
Running tests without recording hypotheses, variables, and results. Loses institutional knowledge.

### AP-16: Niche-Hopping in Lead Generation
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic
Switching target audiences repeatedly instead of mastering one. Same principle as niche-hopping in $100M Offers.
> "People try shortcuts for a decade until they realize they should have picked a strategy and stuck with it for a decade."

### AP-17: Content Without Structure
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical
Creating content without the Hook-Retain-Reward framework. Random value delivery without attention mechanics.

### AP-18: Fake Urgency or Scarcity in Ads
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical
Using countdown timers or limited spots when neither is real. Destroys credibility permanently.

## CONCRETE EXAMPLES

### EX-01: The 300 Flyers Story (Volume Deficit)
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
**Demonstrates:** AP-01 (Volume Deficit) and DR-39 (Volume Diagnostic)
Hormozi put out 300 flyers for his gym. Got zero leads. His mentor tested with 5,000 per day and expected 0.5-1% response rate. With 300, even a 0.5% response = 1.5 people -- impossible to know if it works. Lesson: Volume is almost always the problem.
> "Hard to know if anything works with such a small number...I test with 5000. Then when we find a winner, we put out 5000 per day, every day, for a month."

### EX-02: Gym Launch Growth Story
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
**Demonstrates:** DR-16 (More Better New), DR-26 (Testing Budget)
After tripling ad budget based on mentor advice: $400K -> $780K (more ads). Tested new audiences, found winner -> $1.2M -> $1.5M. Added text blasts to follow up -> $1.8M. Improved ad production -> $2.5M. Launched affiliate program -> $4M/month. Portfolio now $16M+/month.
Shows the MORE -> BETTER -> NEW sequence playing out in real life.

### EX-03: The "Do You Know Anyone" Script
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** DR-07 (Warm Outreach Script), F-05 (ACA)
```
"Hey [Name], I just started [thing]. I'm really good at [specific result].
I'm looking for [X] more people to work with. Do you know anyone who
would be interested in [specific dream outcome]?"
```
Uses indirect referral ask. They either refer someone or say "actually, me."

### EX-04: The "100 Per Day" Outreach Story
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
**Demonstrates:** DR-17 (Rule of 100), AP-01 (Volume Deficit)
> "Alex, I reached out to 100 people over the last six weeks, I only got one customer, it doesn't work." Response: "You did 1/42 of the amount of work required. It was 100 per day, not 100 over time."

### EX-05: Eight-Figure Mastermind Story
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 2-strategic
**Demonstrates:** DR-26 (Testing Budget), P-12 (Win or Learn)
Hormozi attended a mastermind he couldn't afford. Speaker shared: spend a percentage of ad budget on testing without expecting returns. This gave Hormozi "permission to fail." Result: tripled ad budget immediately, grew from $400K to $780K in one month.

### EX-06: Prestige Labs Affiliate Launch
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 3-tactical
**Demonstrates:** F-16 (Affiliate Army), F-17 (Whisper-Tease-Shout)
Referenced as the model for how Hormozi launched his supplement brand through gym owner affiliates. Used the 6-step process: found gym owners (ideal affiliates), made an offer, qualified them, set pay structure, launched with Whisper-Tease-Shout, integrated.

### EX-07: Kylie Jenner Realization
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical
**Demonstrates:** P-06 (Compounding Through People)
Referenced as the moment Hormozi realized that building a network of affiliates/partners creates compounding returns -- like how Kylie Jenner's audience meant anything she launched was immediately profitable.

### AI-02: Pre-Writing Checklist
**Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION | **Layer:** 2-strategic
Before writing ANY lead generation copy, determine:
1. [ ] WHO is the target? (Specific avatar, not broad category)
2. [ ] WARM or COLD audience? (Determines entire approach)
3. [ ] 1-to-1 or 1-to-many? (Determines format and personalization level)
4. [ ] What Core Four method? (Warm Outreach / Content / Cold Outreach / Paid Ads)
5. [ ] What is the dream outcome for this audience?
6. [ ] What lead magnet or offer is being promoted?
7. [ ] Is this a GIVE or an ASK? (Check give:ask ratio)
8. [ ] What is the one specific action the reader should take?
9. [ ] What proof elements are available? (Testimonials, results, case studies)
10. [ ] What scarcity/urgency is real and honest?

### AI-03: Writing Rules Ranked by Importance
**Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION | **Layer:** 2-strategic

**MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable):**
1. Lead with value, not with pitch. In every medium, provide value before asking.
2. Hook first, always. If the hook fails, nothing else matters.
3. Be specific. Specific avatars, specific outcomes, specific numbers, specific timeframes.
4. Use the right Core Four structure. Do not mix warm outreach language in paid ads or vice versa.
5. Maintain give:ask ratio. Minimum 3:1, ideal much higher.
6. Personalize cold outreach. Mass blast = zero response.
7. Include a clear, specific CTA with reasons to act now.

**SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations):**
8. Frame benefits through the Value Equation (Dream Outcome / Likelihood / Time / Effort).
9. Use What-Who-When for ad angle generation -- do not guess at angles.
10. Structure content as Hook-Retain-Reward.
11. Include fast wins and proof elements.
12. Address objections within the copy.
13. Name everything compellingly (lead magnets, bonuses, offers).

**NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable):**
14. Use the indirect referral ask for warm outreach ("Do you know anyone who...").
15. Apply Whisper-Tease-Shout for launches.
16. Stack multiple proof types (testimonials + case studies + data).

### AI-04: Post-Writing Quality Checks
**Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION | **Layer:** 2-strategic
After writing any lead generation copy, verify:

1. **Hook Test:** Would the target avatar stop scrolling? Is there a specific headline component (Recency/Relevancy/Celebrity/Proximity/Conflict/Unusual/Ongoing)?
2. **Avatar Specificity Test:** Can you name the exact person this is for? Would they recognize themselves?
3. **Value-First Test:** Does the copy lead with value or does it lead with a pitch? (Must be value-first)
4. **Core Four Alignment:** Is the copy structured correctly for its Core Four method?
5. **Give:Ask Ratio Check:** If content, does this maintain the overall give:ask ratio?
6. **CTA Clarity Test:** Is there ONE clear action? Do they know EXACTLY what to do?
7. **Reason-Why Test:** Are there real reasons to act now (not fake urgency)?
8. **Personalization Check (cold only):** Does this feel personal, not mass-blasted?
9. **Volume Readiness Test:** Can this be sent/posted at volume (100/day)?
10. **Dream Outcome Check:** Does the copy paint the destination, not the vehicle?
11. **Proof Check:** Is there at least one proof element (testimonial, result, case study)?
12. **Goodwill Check (referral copy only):** Does the underlying product deliver sufficient value to justify the referral ask?
