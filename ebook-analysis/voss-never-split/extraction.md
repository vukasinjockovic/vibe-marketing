## 1. DECISION RULES

### DR-01: Voice Tone Selection
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF writing to a hostile or resistant reader -> Use the written equivalent of the Late-Night FM DJ Voice: calm, measured, downward-inflecting sentences. Short. Declarative. No exclamation marks.

IF writing to a neutral or warm reader -> Use the Positive/Playful voice: light, encouraging, conversational. Smile-in-the-voice prose.

IF writing requires a firm boundary or non-negotiable statement -> Use the Assertive voice RARELY and briefly. One sentence, no hedging.

> "There are essentially three voice tones available to negotiators: 1. The late-night FM DJ voice... 2. The positive/playful voice: Should be your default voice... 3. The direct or assertive voice: Used rarely."
-- Ch. 2

### DR-02: Mirroring for Written Copy
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF the reader has a known objection or stated concern -> Mirror it by repeating their exact words or phrases back to them in copy before responding. This creates rapport and signals "I heard you."

IF you want to draw out more engagement -> End a section by mirroring the reader's likely internal question. This invites them to keep reading.

> "For the FBI, a 'mirror' is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said."
-- Ch. 2

### DR-03: Labeling the Reader's Emotions
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF the reader is likely experiencing negative emotions (fear, skepticism, frustration) -> Label those emotions explicitly: "It seems like you're worried about..." / "It sounds like you've been burned before..."

IF the reader has positive emotions (excitement, ambition, hope) -> Label and reinforce: "It sounds like you're ready to..." / "It seems like you already know..."

ALWAYS use third-person phrasing ("It seems..." / "It sounds...") -- NEVER "I think you feel..." The word "I" raises the reader's guard.

ALWAYS follow a label with silence (in written copy: a line break, visual pause, or let-it-land moment before continuing).

> "Labels almost always begin with roughly the same words: It seems like... It sounds like... It looks like... Notice we said 'It sounds like...' and not 'I'm hearing that...' That's because the word 'I' gets people's guard up."
-- Ch. 3

### DR-04: Accusation Audit Before the Pitch
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF you are about to make a request, pitch, or ask for commitment -> First perform an Accusation Audit: list every negative thing the reader could think about you, your product, or your offer, and say them first.

IF the reader has had negative experiences with your category -> Name those experiences before pitching. This defuses the amygdala response.

> "The first step of doing so is listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you, in what I call an accusation audit."
-- Ch. 3

### DR-05: Triggering "No" Instead of "Yes"
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF writing CTAs, subject lines, or engagement hooks -> Frame questions so the reader says "No" rather than "Yes." "No" gives feelings of safety and control.

INSTEAD OF "Do you want to grow your business?" -> WRITE "Is it a bad idea to leave money on the table?"

INSTEAD OF "Ready to get started?" -> WRITE "Have you given up on [solving this problem]?"

> "If you're trying to sell something, don't start with 'Do you have a few minutes to talk?' Instead ask, 'Is now a bad time to talk?'"
-- Ch. 4

### DR-06: Driving Toward "That's Right"
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF you need the reader to feel deeply understood before presenting your solution -> Write a summary of their world: paraphrase their situation + label their emotions. The goal is to make the reader think "That's right."

IF you get "You're right" energy (polite agreement, no action) -> You have NOT reached the reader. Rewrite with deeper empathy.

> "'That's right' is better than 'yes.' Strive for it. Reaching 'that's right' in a negotiation creates breakthroughs."
-- Ch. 5

> "Use a summary to trigger a 'that's right.' The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing."
-- Ch. 5

### DR-07: Loss Framing Over Gain Framing
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF presenting benefits -> Always include what the reader LOSES by not acting. Loss aversion is stronger than gain attraction.

IF the reader is on the fence -> Frame inaction as the risky choice, not action.

> "To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through."
-- Ch. 6

### DR-08: Calibrated Questions as Section Headers
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF writing educational or problem-solving content -> Use calibrated "How" and "What" questions as section headers or subheads. These give the reader the illusion of control and make them think expansively.

NEVER use "Why" questions (accusatory). INSTEAD OF "Why aren't you getting results?" -> WRITE "What's preventing you from getting results?"

> "Calibrated questions avoid verbs or words like 'can,' 'is,' 'are,' 'do,' or 'does.' Instead, they start with 'who,' 'what,' 'when,' 'where,' 'why,' and 'how.' ... it's best to start with 'what,' 'how,' and sometimes 'why.'"
-- Ch. 7

### DR-09: Negotiator Type Adaptation
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF writing to Analysts (methodical, data-driven audience) -> Lead with data, use precise numbers, avoid surprises, give them time to process. Do not rush to a CTA.

IF writing to Accommodators (relationship-focused audience) -> Be warm, build rapport, use "we" language, focus on shared values. Push gently toward action since they avoid conflict.

IF writing to Assertives (results-driven audience) -> Get to the point fast. Let them feel heard first, then present your case. Use mirrors and labels to show understanding before making your pitch.

> "Some people are Accommodators; others -- like me -- are basically Assertive; and the rest are data-loving Analysts."
-- Ch. 9

### DR-10: The "How" Deflection for Price/Objection Content
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF addressing price objections in copy -> Do not argue or justify. Instead ask a calibrated "How" question that makes the reader solve their own objection: "How would you feel if this investment paid for itself in 30 days?"

IF the reader objects with "too expensive" -> Frame as "How am I supposed to..." which triggers empathy.

> "'How am I supposed to do that?' became our primary response to a kidnapper demanding a ransom. And we never had it backfire."
-- Ch. 8

### DR-11: The Rule of Three in Copy
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF you need to verify commitment or reinforce a message -> Present the same core idea three times in different forms: once as a direct statement, once as a label/summary, once as a calibrated question.

> "The Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. It's tripling the strength of whatever dynamic you're trying to drill into at the moment."
-- Ch. 8

### DR-12: Four-Step "No" Escalation for Objection Handling
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF handling objections in a sales page or email sequence -> Use the graduated "No" system:
1. "How am I supposed to do that?" (deferential request for help)
2. "Your offer is very generous... that just doesn't work for me" (soft no with flattery)
3. "I'm sorry but I'm afraid I just can't do that" (expression of inability, triggers empathy)
4. "I'm sorry, no" (direct but gentle)

> "We've found that you can usually express 'No' four times before actually saying the word."
-- Ch. 8

---

## 2. FORMULAS & TEMPLATES

### F-01: The Mirroring Formula (4-Step)
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

1. Use the Late-Night FM DJ voice (calm, measured prose)
2. Start with "I'm sorry..."
3. Mirror (repeat last 1-3 critical words of the reader's likely thought)
4. Silence (pause in copy -- let it sit)
5. Repeat

> "It's just four simple steps: 1. Use the late-night FM DJ voice. 2. Start with 'I'm sorry...' 3. Mirror. 4. Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart. 5. Repeat."
-- Ch. 2

### F-02: The Labeling Formula
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

Template: "It seems like [emotion/fear/desire]..." + SILENCE

Variations:
- "It seems like..."
- "It sounds like..."
- "It looks like..."

NEVER: "I'm hearing that..." / "I think you feel..." / "What I'm sensing is..."

> "Labels almost always begin with roughly the same words: It seems like... It sounds like... It looks like..."
-- Ch. 3

### F-03: The Accusation Audit Template
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 2-strategic

Before any pitch, list and preempt every objection:

"You're probably thinking [worst objection]. You might even feel [second worst]. And honestly, you might be right to wonder [third worst]."

Then flip: "And yet..."

> "'You're going to think I'm a lousy businessman. You're going to think I can't budget or plan...' And then, once I'd anchored their emotions in a minefield of low expectations, I played on their loss aversion."
-- Ch. 6

### F-04: The "No"-Oriented Email Template
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 4-specific

Subject line or opening line for re-engagement:

"Have you given up on [this project / solving X / achieving Y]?"

> "You provoke a 'No' with this one-sentence email. Have you given up on this project?"
-- Ch. 4

### F-05: The Summary-to-"That's Right" Formula
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

Structure: Paraphrase their world + Label their emotions = Summary that triggers "That's right"

Template: "So what you're dealing with is [paraphrase their situation in their words]. And it seems like that makes you feel [label their underlying emotion]."

> "A good summary is the combination of rearticulating the meaning of what is said plus the acknowledgment of the emotions underlying that meaning (paraphrasing + labeling = summary)."
-- Ch. 5

### F-06: The Ackerman Bargaining System
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

1. Set your target price (your goal)
2. Set your first offer at 65% of your target price
3. Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85%, 95%, and 100%)
4. Use empathy and different ways of saying "No" to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer
5. When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like $37,893 rather than $38,000
6. On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they probably don't want) to show you're at your limit

> "The Ackerman model is an offer-counteroffer method... The systematized and easy-to-remember process has only four steps."
-- Ch. 9

### F-07: The Negotiation One Sheet (5 Sections)
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 2-strategic

Section I: THE GOAL -- Write down your specific best-case goal.
Section II: SUMMARY -- 2-3 sentences of known facts that get "That's right."
Section III: LABELS/ACCUSATION AUDIT -- 3-5 labels to preempt accusations.
Section IV: CALIBRATED QUESTIONS -- 3-5 "How"/"What" questions to reveal value.
Section V: NONCASH OFFERS -- List of nonmonetary items you can offer.

-- Appendix

### F-08: Calibrated Question Templates
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

Standbys for nearly every situation:
- "What about this is important to you?"
- "How can I help to make this better for us?"
- "How would you like me to proceed?"
- "What is it that brought us into this situation?"
- "How can we solve this problem?"
- "What's the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?"
- "How am I supposed to do that?"

Behind-the-table questions:
- "How does this affect the rest of your team?"
- "How on board are the people not on this call?"
- "What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?"

-- Ch. 7, Appendix

### F-09: The Fill-in-the-Blank Label Templates
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 4-specific

- "It seems like _________ is valuable to you."
- "It seems like you don't like _________."
- "It seems like you value __________."
- "It seems like _________ makes it easier."
- "It seems like you're reluctant to _________."
- "It seems like __________ is important."
- "It seems you feel like my company is in a unique position to __________."
- "It seems like you are worried that __________."

-- Appendix

### F-10: The Multi-Step "No" Script
**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 4-specific

Step 1 (Email): "Have you given up on settling this amicably?"
Step 2 (Label): "It seems that you feel my bill is not justified."
Step 3 (Calibrated Q): "How does this bill violate our agreement?"
Step 4 (No-oriented Qs): "Are you saying I misled you?" / "Are you saying I didn't do as you asked?"
Step 5 (Label/Mirror): "It seems like you feel my work was subpar." Or "...my work was subpar?"
Step 6 (Calibrated Q): "How am I supposed to accept that?"
Step 7 (Flattering label): "It seems like you are the type of person who prides himself on the way he does business..."
Step 8 (Final No-Q): "Do you want to be known as someone who doesn't fulfill agreements?"

> "From my long experience in negotiation, scripts like this have a 90 percent success rate."
-- Ch. 7

## 3. PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### P-01: Tactical Empathy
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

Empathy is not agreement or sympathy. It is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment AND hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence. It is the foundation of ALL other techniques.

> "Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow."
-- Ch. 3

### P-02: Emotions Are the Means, Not the Obstacle
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

> "Emotions aren't the obstacles, they are the means."
-- Ch. 3

Emotions are not noise to be filtered out -- they are the primary channel through which influence operates. All decisions are ultimately emotional.

> "While we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is governed by emotion."
-- Ch. 6

### P-03: The Illusion of Control
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

People need to feel in control. When they feel they are making the decisions, they become more cooperative. The mechanism: ask questions that make the counterpart think THEY are driving the conversation, when you are actually framing it.

> "The secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control."
-- Ch. 7

### P-04: Loss Aversion (Prospect Theory)
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

People take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains (Kahneman & Tversky). In writing: frame what the reader loses by not acting, not just what they gain by acting.

> "People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain."
-- Ch. 6

### P-05: The Certainty Effect
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

People are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice. In copy: present your offer as the certain outcome rather than a gamble.

-- Ch. 6

### P-06: Neural Resonance
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

When we closely observe and mirror another person's communications, our brains begin to align. Good listeners can anticipate what the speaker will say. In writing: demonstrate you understand the reader's world so deeply they feel neural alignment.

> "In an fMRI brain-scan experiment, researchers at Princeton University found that neural resonance disappears when people communicate poorly."
-- Ch. 3

### P-07: Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM)
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

Five stages: Active Listening -> Empathy -> Rapport -> Influence -> Behavioral Change. You cannot skip stages. You must earn each level before attempting the next.

> "The model proposes five stages -- active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral change -- that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior."
-- Ch. 5

### P-08: The Amygdala Interrupt
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

Labeling a fear activates rational brain regions and reduces amygdala (fear center) activity. By naming the reader's fears in writing, you literally defuse their physiological fear response.

> "When people are shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater activity in the amygdala... But when they are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that govern rational thinking."
-- Ch. 3

### P-09: "No" as Safety Mechanism
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

"No" provides feelings of safety, security, and control. It preserves autonomy. When you allow people to say "No," their defenses lower and real negotiation begins.

> "It comes down to the deep and universal human need for autonomy. People need to feel in control. When you preserve a person's autonomy by clearly giving them permission to say 'No' to your ideas, the emotions calm."
-- Ch. 4

### P-10: Fairness as Emotional Driver
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

"Fair" is the most powerful word in negotiation. People will sacrifice rational self-interest to punish perceived unfairness. Three uses:
1. Defensive judo: "We just want what's fair" (destabilizes other side)
2. Nefarious accusation: "We've given you a fair offer" (manipulative)
3. Positive: "I want you to feel treated fairly at all times" (builds trust)

> "The most powerful word in negotiations is 'Fair.'"
-- Ch. 6

### P-11: Reciprocity Dynamic
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

When someone gives you something, you feel obligated to give back. In copy: give value first (insights, tools, genuine help) and the reader feels an urge to reciprocate with attention, trust, or purchase.

> "A universal rule of human nature, across all cultures, is that when somebody gives you something, they expect something in return."
-- Ch. 7

### P-12: Three Types of Leverage
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

Positive Leverage: You can give them what they want or withhold it.
Negative Leverage: You can cause them pain or loss.
Normative Leverage: You can hold them to their own stated standards/beliefs.

> "At a taxonomic level, there are three kinds: Positive, Negative, and Normative."
-- Ch. 10

### P-13: Black Swan Theory (in Negotiation)
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

Every negotiation contains at least three "Black Swans" -- unknown unknowns that, if discovered, change everything. The job of the negotiator is to uncover them through deep listening and calibrated questions.

> "I began to hypothesize that in every negotiation each side is in possession of at least three Black Swans, three pieces of information that, were they to be discovered by the other side, would change everything."
-- Ch. 10

### P-14: Never Split the Difference
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

Compromise is not a virtue. "No deal is better than a bad deal." Splitting the difference produces outcomes worse than either party's position. In writing: do not water down your message to please everyone.

> "We don't compromise because it's right; we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face."
-- Ch. 6

### P-15: "Yes" Is Nothing Without "How"
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

Agreement without implementation is worthless. Three kinds of "Yes": Counterfeit (to escape), Confirmation (reflexive), Commitment (leads to action). Only Commitment matters.

> "'Yes' is nothing without 'How.' While an agreement is nice, a contract is better, and a signed check is best."
-- Ch. 8

---

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS & WARNINGS

### AP-01: Never Push for "Yes"
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

Pushing hard for "Yes" triggers defensiveness. The reader feels hunted. Every "yes" question in copy that feels like a trap ("Don't you want to be successful?") activates resistance.

> "Pushing hard for 'Yes' doesn't get a negotiator any closer to a win; it just angers the other side."
-- Ch. 4

### AP-02: Never Use "I" Framing in Labels
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical

"I think you feel..." / "I'm hearing that..." makes it about YOU and raises the reader's guard. Always use "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..."

> "The word 'I' gets people's guard up. When you say 'I,' it says you're more interested in yourself than the other person."
-- Ch. 3

### AP-03: Never Ask "Why" (Unless Strategically)
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical

"Why" is accusatory in any language. It makes people defensive. The ONLY time to use it: when the defensiveness serves your argument. "Why would you ever go back to the old way?"

> "'Why' can backfire. Regardless of what language the word 'why' is translated into, it's accusatory."
-- Ch. 7

### AP-04: Never Deny Negatives
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

Saying "I don't want to sound harsh..." or "I don't want this to seem like a sales pitch..." CONFIRMS the negative. Instead, label it directly using an accusation audit.

> "The small but critical mistake this commits is denying the negative. That actually gives it credence."
-- Ch. 3

### AP-05: Beware "You're Right"
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

If the reader mentally says "You're right," you have FAILED. It is a dismissal, not agreement. It means "go away, I don't want to engage." Target "That's right" instead.

> "'You're right' is the worst answer... Tell people 'you're right' and they get a happy smile on their face and leave you alone for at least twenty-four hours. But you haven't agreed to their position."
-- Ch. 5

### AP-06: Never Make Threats Explicitly
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

Direct threats destroy trust and trigger the "paradox of power" -- the harder you push, the more resistance you meet. Instead, label the negative consequence subtly.

> "Threats can be like nuclear bombs. There will be a toxic residue that will be difficult to clean up."
-- Ch. 10

### AP-07: Never Let Logic Lead Alone
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 0-foundational

Logic-first arguments fail because decisions are emotional. The Harvard negotiation approach (BATNA, ZOPA, rational analysis) consistently loses to emotional intelligence approaches.

> "Without a deep understanding of human psychology, without the acceptance that we are all crazy, irrational, impulsive, emotionally driven animals, all the raw intelligence and mathematical logic in the world is little help."
-- Ch. 1

### AP-08: Never Go Too Fast
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

Speed kills rapport. In copy: do not rush to the pitch. Build empathy first. Label fears. Let the reader feel heard.

> "Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making."
-- Ch. 2

### AP-09: Never Ignore the "Team Behind the Table"
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

The decision maker you are writing to is influenced by others (spouse, boss, peers). Your copy must address those hidden influencers or your "yes" will be overruled later.

> "If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable."
-- Ch. 7

### AP-10: The "I'll Try" Warning
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical

If your copy generates "I'll try" energy from the reader, that means "I plan to fail." Rewrite to get active commitment, not passive intent.

> "When you push for implementation and they say, 'I'll try,' you should get a sinking feeling in your stomach. Because this really means, 'I plan to fail.'"
-- Ch. 8

---

## 5. CONCRETE EXAMPLES

### EX-01: Harvard Roleplay -- Calibrated Questions Defeat Logic
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Calibrated Questions (F-08), Illusion of Control (P-03)

Harvard professors Mnookin and Blum roleplay kidnappers. Voss, with no academic credentials, defeats them both by repeatedly asking: "How am I supposed to do that?"

> "'How am I supposed to do that?' Mnookin paused. His expression had a touch of amused pity in it... Blum interjected. 'Don't let him do that to you,' she said."
-- Ch. 1

**Why it works in copy:** Open-ended questions make the reader solve your problem for you. They feel in control while you guide the direction.

### EX-02: Chase Manhattan Bank Robbery -- Mirroring Extracts Information
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Mirroring (F-01), DJ Voice (DR-01)

Voss mirrors bank robber Chris Watts: "We chased your driver away?" Watts blurts information about an unknown accomplice. Later, mirroring Bobby Goodwin with calm voice leads to surrender.

> "'We chased your driver away?' I mirrored. 'Well, when he seen the police he cut.'"
-- Ch. 2

**Why it works in copy:** Reflecting the reader's own words back creates instant rapport and makes them elaborate.

### EX-03: Harlem Standoff -- Labeling Through a Door
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Labeling (F-02), Tactical Empathy (P-01)

Three armed fugitives, no phone. Voss speaks through the door for 6 hours using labels: "It looks like you don't want to come out. It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we'll come in with guns blazing."

All three surrender. Their reason: "You calmed us down. We finally believed you wouldn't go away."

-- Ch. 3

**Why it works in copy:** You do not need a two-way conversation to use empathy. Naming the reader's fears in a one-way medium (copy) still defuses their amygdala.

### EX-04: Washington Redskins -- Labeling Rewrites a Collections Script
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Labeling (F-02), Accusation Audit (F-03)

TJ rewrites a collections script for delinquent season ticket holders. Old script: aggressive, "me me me." New script: "YOUR Washington Redskins... the home-field advantage created by you... In these difficult times, we understand our fans have been hit hard." Result: payment plans with all delinquent holders before the season opener.

-- Ch. 3

**Why it works in copy:** Changing copy from seller-centric to buyer-centric, with empathetic labeling, transforms response rates without changing the offer.

### EX-05: Ryan's Flight Upgrade -- Full Technique Stack
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Label + Mirror + Tactical Silence combined

Ryan approaches a gate agent after an angry couple leaves:
"Hi, Wendy, I'm Ryan. It seems like they were pretty upset." (Label)
"The weather?" (Mirror)
"Booked solid?" (Mirror)
"Well, it seems like you've been handling the rough day pretty well." (Label)

Result: boarding pass to sold-out flight + Economy Plus upgrade in under 2 minutes.

> "Listen to that riff: Label, tactical empathy, label. And only then a request."
-- Ch. 3

### EX-06: Political Fund-Raising -- "No"-Oriented Script Beats "Yes" Script
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** "No" Technique (DR-05)

Ben Ottenhoff rewrites fund-raising script from "Yes" pattern to "No" pattern:

OLD: "Do you believe gas prices are too high?" -> "Yes" -> "Can you give money?"
NEW: "Do you feel that if things stay the way they are, America's best days are ahead of it?" -> "No" -> "Are you going to sit and watch without putting up a fight?" -> "No"

Result: 23% better rate of return.

-- Ch. 4

### EX-07: Anna's $1 Million -- Accusation Audit Saves a Contract
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Accusation Audit (F-03), Labeling (F-02)

Anna must tell partner ABC Corp they're being cut from 5.5 to 3 people. She opens: "We understand that we brought you on board with the shared goal of having you lead this work. You may feel like we have treated you unfairly... We acknowledge that you believe you were promised this work."

Result: ABC Corp says "You are not the 'Big Bad Prime.'" Anna's company saves $1 million.

-- Ch. 3

### EX-08: Haiti Kidnapping -- Ackerman System Gets Hostage for $4,751
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Ackerman Model (F-06), Calibrated Questions (F-08), Nonround Numbers

$150,000 demand. Voss uses: calibrated questions to stall, fairness framing, extreme low anchor of $3,000, decreasing increments, precise nonround final number of $4,751, plus a portable CD stereo as nonmonetary throw-in. Hostage released safely.

-- Ch. 6

### EX-09: "Have You Given Up?" Email
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** "No"-Oriented Email (F-04)

When being ignored, send: "Have you given up on this project?" The "No" answer the email demands offers safety and illusion of control while making an implicit threat to walk away.

> "This one-sentence email encapsulates the best of 'No'-oriented questions and plays on your counterpart's natural human aversion to loss."
-- Ch. 4

### EX-10: Angel Prado Salary Negotiation -- Full Stack
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Anchoring, Nonround Numbers, Ranges, Fair, Labels, Calibrated Questions

Angel uses: nonspecific anchor (tuition money = $31k), new title request (nonmonetary pivot), lets boss go first ($31k offer), presents range "$134.5k--$143k" on job description, boss negotiates with himself up to $134,500. Seals it with "That's fair" and recruits boss as mentor.

> "His boss said he agreed with the $134,500... 'I'll fight to get you this salary.'"
-- Ch. 6

## 6. AGENT INSTRUCTIONS (Synthesis)

### AI-01: Pre-Writing Checklist

Before writing ANY marketing copy, determine:

1. **Reader's Emotional State:** What is the reader feeling right now? Scared? Hopeful? Frustrated? Skeptical?
2. **Reader's Fears:** What are they afraid of? List 3-5 specific fears.
3. **Reader's Desired Identity:** Who do they want to be? What does success look like to them?
4. **Objections:** What will they think is wrong with your offer? List every possible accusation.
5. **Hidden Influencers:** Who else affects their decision? Spouse? Boss? Peers?
6. **Negotiator Type:** Is this audience primarily Analyst, Accommodator, or Assertive?
7. **Loss Frame:** What do they lose by NOT acting? (More powerful than what they gain by acting)

  v
What is the reader's emotional state?
  HOSTILE/SKEPTICAL -> Open with Accusation Audit (F-03)
                       Then Label fears (F-02)
                       Then Summary to trigger "That's Right" (F-05)
                       Then present solution
  |
  NEUTRAL/CURIOUS  -> Open with Calibrated Question as hook (F-08)
                      Then Label their situation (F-02)
                      Then present solution with loss framing (DR-07)
  |
  WARM/READY       -> Open with Summary of their world (F-05)
                      Then "That's Right" trigger
                      Then present solution
                      Then address behind-the-table influencers (AP-09)
  |
  ALL PATHS -> Close with "No"-oriented CTA (DR-05)
               Verify with Rule of Three (DR-11)
```

### AI-03: Writing Rules Ranked

**MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable):**
1. Never use "I" framing in labels. Always "It seems like..." (AP-02)
2. Never push for "Yes" early. Drive toward "No" first. (AP-01, DR-05)
3. Always perform an Accusation Audit before pitching. (DR-04)
4. Frame losses before gains. (DR-07)
5. Use calibrated "How"/"What" questions, never "Why." (DR-08, AP-03)
6. Emotions first, logic second. Always. (P-02, AP-07)

**SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations):**
7. Mirror the reader's language back to them before introducing your own. (DR-02)
8. Build to "That's Right" before presenting the solution. (DR-06)
9. Use nonround, precise numbers for any pricing. (F-06)
10. Address hidden influencers in the copy. (AP-09)
11. Adapt tone to negotiator type. (DR-09)

**NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable):**
12. Use the "Have you given up?" template for re-engagement. (F-04)
13. Apply the Ackerman model for pricing reveals. (F-06)
14. Use the Chris Discount -- humanize yourself with a name. (Ch. 8)

### AI-04: Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify ALL of these:

1. **Empathy Check:** Does the opening demonstrate understanding of the reader's world BEFORE making any claim? Would the reader say "That's right" after the first paragraph?
2. **Accusation Audit Check:** Are objections addressed preemptively, or do they lurk unanswered?
3. **Label Scan:** Are emotions named explicitly using "It seems like..." phrasing? Or are they just implied?
4. **"No" Orientation:** Are CTAs framed to trigger "No" rather than pushing for "Yes"?
5. **Loss Frame:** Is there a clear statement of what the reader loses by inaction?
6. **"Why" Purge:** Search for any "Why" questions and replace with "What" or "How."
7. **"I" Purge in Labels:** Search for "I think you..." / "I feel like you..." and replace with "It seems..."
8. **Speed Check:** Does the copy rush to the pitch? Or does it earn the right through empathy first?
9. **Rule of Three:** Is the core message reinforced at least three times in different forms?
10. **Behind-the-Table:** Does the copy address or acknowledge other people who influence the reader's decision?

### AI-05: Translating Verbal Techniques to Written Copy

| Verbal Technique | Written Equivalent |
|---|---|
| Late-Night FM DJ Voice | Calm, short, declarative sentences. No exclamation marks. Downward energy. |
| Positive/Playful Voice | Conversational, warm, uses "you" language, light humor. Default tone. |
| Mirroring (repeat words) | Echo reader's likely internal monologue or use their exact phrases from reviews/forums. |
| Labeling (name emotions) | "It seems like you..." sentences scattered through copy to name what the reader feels. |
| Tactical Silence (pause) | Line breaks, white space, single-sentence paragraphs. Let a powerful label SIT before continuing. |
| Accusation Audit | Objection-handling section that OPENS the page, not closes it. Name every fear first. |
| Calibrated Questions | Section headers as questions. "How would your mornings change if...?" Not "Why haven't you...?" |
| "No"-oriented questions | CTAs that let the reader say "No" to the status quo. "Is it worth risking another year of...?" |
| "That's right" trigger | Summary paragraphs that reflect the reader's worldview so accurately they nod and keep reading. |
| Rule of Three | Present core message as: (1) direct claim, (2) testimonial/story, (3) "What if..." question. |
| Fairness framing | "We want this to feel fair to you" + transparency about pricing/terms. |
| Loss aversion anchoring | "Without this, you'll continue to..." before "With this, you'll..." |
| Ackerman pricing | Reveal pricing in decreasing increments across an email sequence or page scroll. |
| Nonround numbers | Use $1,847 instead of $1,900. Precision signals calculation, not guessing. |
| The Chris Discount | Sign off with a real name. Humanize the sender/brand. Make it personal. |
