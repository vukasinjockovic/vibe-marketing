## 1. DECISION RULES

### DR-01: The Click-Run Principle
**IF** a trigger feature is present **THEN** the corresponding automatic behavior program activates without conscious deliberation.
> "Click, and the appropriate program is activated; run, and out rolls the standard sequence of behaviors." (Ch. 1)
- Type: Principle | Layer: 0

### DR-02: When to Use Reciprocity
**IF** you want compliance from a prospect **THEN** provide value first (gift, favor, information, concession) before making your request. The gift need not be large -- a small, personalized favor triggers disproportionate obligation.
> "The rule says that we should try to repay what another person has provided us." (Ch. 2)
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-03: Customization Supercharges Reciprocity
**IF** you can match the gift to the recipient's current needs or preferences **THEN** the reciprocity effect is amplified dramatically.
> "Problem-free may not feel as good to people as problem-freed." (Ch. 2)
- Visitors given yogurt (matching food need) at a restaurant bought 24% more vs. 12% more from a key ring gift of equal value.
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-04: Rejection-Then-Retreat (Door-in-the-Face)
**IF** you want compliance with a moderate request **THEN** first ask for something larger that will be refused, then "retreat" to your real request. The second request appears as a concession, triggering reciprocal concession.
> "Three times as many of the students approached in this manner volunteered to serve as zoo chaperons." (Ch. 2)
- Warning: First request must not be so extreme as to appear unreasonable, or the tactic backfires.
- Bonus: Produces greater follow-through AND willingness to agree to future requests.
- Type: Formula | Layer: 2

### DR-05: When to Use Liking
**IF** you want to increase compliance **THEN** establish genuine liking through five factors: physical attractiveness (grooming/presentation), similarity (shared traits, mirrored language), compliments (genuine praise), familiarity (repeated contact), and association (link to positive things).
> "There is nothing more effective in selling anything than getting customers to believe, really believe, you like them." -- Joe Girard (Ch. 3)
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-06: Similarity Drives Liking Automatically
**IF** you can find and communicate genuine similarities with the audience **THEN** liking and compliance increase substantially -- even for trivial commonalities.
> "We like people who are like us." (Ch. 3)
- Use the audience's own language, words, phrases, slang.
- Mirror verbal and nonverbal style -- servers who mimic customers' words get higher tips.
- Name similarities, shared backgrounds, common interests.
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-07: Compliments That Create Behavior Change
**IF** you want someone to continue a desirable behavior **THEN** compliment the trait behind the behavior, not just the behavior itself.
> "Children praised for their conscientiousness on a task performed more conscientiously on a related task days afterward." (Ch. 3)
- Altercasting: Assign a role via compliment ("You're the kind of person who...") and the person acts in accord.
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 3

### DR-08: When to Use Social Proof
**IF** the audience is uncertain about the right choice **THEN** social proof is most effective. Show what many similar others are doing.
> "Since 95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer." (Ch. 4)
- Three optimizers: Uncertainty (when people don't know what to do), The Many (the more doing it, the stronger), Similarity (peer-suasion -- similar others most compelling).
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-09: Popularity Labels Beat All Other Labels
**IF** you need to promote an item from a set **THEN** label it "most popular" rather than "specialty" or "recommended."
> "Sales of each dish jumped by an average of 13 to 20 percent" when labeled "most popular." (Ch. 4)
- "The dishes became more popular because of their popularity."
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-10: The Big Mistake -- Never Normalize Undesirable Behavior
**IF** you want to discourage a behavior **THEN** never communicate that many people do it. Within the lament "Look at all the people doing this bad thing" lurks the message "Look at all the people doing it."
> "The sign nearly tripled theft, to 7.92 percent" when it depicted multiple thieves. The sign showing a lone thief "reduced larceny to 1.67 percent." (Ch. 4)
- Type: Anti-Pattern | Layer: 2

### DR-11: Future Social Proof (Trending)
**IF** you lack current widespread popularity **THEN** show honest evidence of growing popularity (a trend). People assume trends will continue.
> "Even though only a minority of peers conserved, the number who did conserve was increasing. So informed, these subjects used the least water of all." (Ch. 4)
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 3

### DR-12: When to Use Authority
**IF** you want immediate compliance **THEN** establish expertise and trustworthiness. The combination is "credible authority."
> "Follow an expert." -- Virgil (Ch. 5)
- Expertise: Demonstrate relevant knowledge, credentials, experience.
- Trustworthiness: Mention a weakness or drawback early -- this builds trust that makes subsequent strengths more believable.
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-13: The Weakness-First Trustworthiness Tactic
**IF** your audience is skeptical **THEN** acknowledge a (usually minor) shortcoming of your case early in the message, then follow immediately with your strongest point. The admission builds credibility.
> "A trial attorney who admits a weakness before the rival attorney points it out is viewed as more credible and wins more often." (Ch. 5)
- Domino's "NEW DOMINO'S" campaign admitted past poor pizza quality -- sales went sky high.
- Warren Buffett opens annual reports with mistakes to build trust for subsequent claims.
- Type: Formula | Layer: 2

### DR-14: Multiple Authorities Beat One
**IF** you cite expert support **THEN** cite multiple experts rather than just one. Audiences trust the aggregate more.
> "Audiences trust and follow the advice of a set of experts more than that of any one of them." (Ch. 5)
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-15: When to Use Scarcity
**IF** you want to increase desire for an offer **THEN** honestly communicate its limited availability (limited number, deadline, exclusive access). Scarcity engages loss aversion.
> "The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost." -- G.K. Chesterton (Ch. 6)
- Newly scarce items are valued more than items that were always scarce.
- Competition for scarce resources intensifies desire further.
- Exclusive information is more persuasive than freely available information.
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-16: When to Use Commitment/Consistency
**IF** you want lasting behavior change **THEN** get an initial small, voluntary, public commitment. People will act consistently with what they have publicly said or done.
> "After making a commitment (that is, taking an action, stand, or position), people are more willing to agree to requests in keeping with the prior commitment." (Ch. 7)
- Commitments are most powerful when: Active (written/spoken, not passive), Public (visible to others), Effortful (required work), Voluntary (not coerced), Identity-changing (shifts self-image).
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-17: Low-Ball Technique
**IF** you secure an initial commitment **THEN** that commitment tends to "grow its own legs" -- the person generates new reasons to justify it, even if the original reason is removed.
> "Commitment decisions, even erroneous ones, have a tendency to be self-perpetuating." (Ch. 7)
- Type: Formula | Layer: 3

### DR-18: When to Use Unity
**IF** you want deep compliance **THEN** establish shared identity ("we"-ness). This goes beyond liking -- it's about belonging to the same group.
> "People say yes to someone they consider one of them." (Ch. 8)
- Created through: Kinship (family, genetic overlap), Place (shared home/locality/region), Acting together (synchronous activity, co-creation, shared suffering, reciprocal exchange).
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 2

### DR-19: Principle Selection -- The Uncertainty Test
**IF** the audience is uncertain about what to do **THEN** prioritize Social Proof. **IF** the audience has low trust **THEN** prioritize Authority (with weakness-first for trustworthiness). **IF** the audience feels no connection **THEN** prioritize Liking or Unity. **IF** the audience is procrastinating **THEN** prioritize Scarcity. **IF** you want lasting behavior change **THEN** prioritize Commitment/Consistency.
- Type: Decision Tree | Layer: 3

### DR-20: Stacking Principles
**IF** multiple principles can be applied simultaneously **THEN** stack them. Combined principles are multiplicative, not additive.
- The Tupperware party deploys ALL seven: Reciprocity (gifts before buying), Liking (friend as hostess), Social Proof (each purchase validates), Authority (certified quality), Scarcity (limited offers), Commitment (public testimonials), Unity ("welcome to the family").
- Rejection-then-retreat engages BOTH reciprocity AND the contrast principle simultaneously.
- CEO letter + gift of sweets = 17% compliance vs. 5% for request alone (Ch. 5).
- Type: Decision Rule | Layer: 3

## 2. FORMULAS & TEMPLATES

### F-01: The Seven Principles of Influence (Exact Definitions)

| # | Principle | Core Mechanism | Trigger |
|---|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | **Reciprocity** | We feel obligated to repay what others give us | Gift, favor, concession |
| 2 | **Liking** | We comply with those we like | Similarity, compliments, familiarity, attractiveness, association |
| 3 | **Social Proof** | We determine correct behavior by observing what others do | Popularity, testimonials, peer behavior |
| 4 | **Authority** | We defer to those with expertise and legitimate power | Titles, credentials, clothing, trustworthiness |
| 5 | **Scarcity** | We value what is rare or diminishing in availability | Limited quantity, deadlines, exclusivity |
| 6 | **Commitment/Consistency** | We strive to be consistent with prior commitments | Small initial agreement, public statement |
| 7 | **Unity** | We say yes to those we consider "one of us" | Shared identity, kinship, co-creation |

### F-02: Reciprocity Sub-Techniques
1. **Gift-then-request**: Give something of value, then make the ask.
2. **Rejection-then-retreat**: Ask big first, get refused, then ask for what you really want.
3. **Personalized gift**: Match the gift to the recipient's specific needs.
4. **Uninvited favor**: The gift need not be requested to create obligation.
5. **Unequal exchange**: Small gifts can trigger disproportionately large return favors.

### F-03: Liking Sub-Techniques
1. **Physical attractiveness**: Good grooming, professional presentation.
2. **Similarity**: Shared background, interests, language, values.
3. **Compliments**: Both direct and behind-the-back; trait-based altercasting.
4. **Familiarity**: Repeated positive contact (Joe Girard's "I like you" cards).
5. **Cooperative framing**: "We're on the same team" positioning.
6. **Association**: Link to positive things (celebrities, success, popular causes).

### F-04: Social Proof Sub-Techniques
1. **Popularity labels**: "Most popular," "best-selling," "fastest-growing."
2. **Testimonials from similar others**: Peer-suasion -- match testimonial to target demographic.
3. **Trending/future social proof**: Show growing adoption even if current numbers are small.
4. **Specific numbers**: "98% of online shoppers say..." "92% of consumers trust..."
5. **Visible behavior**: Show others doing the action (photos, video, queues).

### F-05: Authority Sub-Techniques
1. **Credential display**: Titles, diplomas, certifications, years of experience.
2. **Expert endorsement**: Cite multiple experts for greater effect.
3. **Weakness-then-strength**: Admit a minor flaw, then present major strengths.
4. **Symbols**: Professional attire, quality trappings, prestigious associations.
5. **Being an authority vs. in authority**: Knowledge-based influence > command-based influence.

### F-06: Scarcity Sub-Techniques
1. **Limited number**: "Only X left."
2. **Deadline**: "Offer ends at midnight."
3. **Exclusive information**: "Not available to the general public."
4. **Newly scarce**: Something that was available but now is being restricted.
5. **Competition**: Others competing for the same item.

### F-07: Commitment/Consistency Sub-Techniques
1. **Foot-in-the-door**: Small initial request leads to larger compliance.
2. **Public commitment**: Written or spoken declarations that bind.
3. **Active participation**: Writing, signing, creating (not passive agreement).
4. **Low-ball**: Secure commitment, then reveal additional costs.
5. **Labeling**: Assign a positive identity trait ("You're very health-conscious").
6. **Reminders**: Re-invoking a prior commitment regenerates and intensifies its force.

### F-08: Unity Sub-Techniques
1. **Kinship framing**: Family language ("welcome to the family").
2. **Place-based identity**: Shared locality, home, region.
3. **Co-creation**: Involve the audience in building something together.
4. **Synchronous action**: Shared musical experience, coordinated activities.
5. **Reciprocal self-disclosure**: Sharing personal information builds "we"-ness.
6. **Shared adversity**: Joint suffering or common enemy creates bonds.

### F-09: The Contrast Principle (Amplifier)
Present a higher-priced/worse option first, then the real offer. The real offer looks even better by comparison.
> "Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison." (Ch. 1)
- Real-estate agents show bad "setup" properties first.
- Auto dealers negotiate car price before suggesting options.

## 3. PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### M-01: Why Automatic Responding Exists
Humans use mental shortcuts (heuristics) because modern life is too complex for full analysis of every decision. These shortcuts are efficient and usually correct, but exploitable.
> "You and I exist in an extraordinarily complicated environment, easily the most rapidly moving and complex ever on this planet." (Ch. 1)
- Type: Mechanism | Layer: 0

### M-02: Why Reciprocity Works
Three mechanisms: (1) Social training from childhood creates deep obligation to repay. (2) Internal discomfort of indebtedness demands relief. (3) External shame -- "moocher" and "taker" are labels people will do almost anything to avoid.
> "There's nothing more expensive than that which comes for free." -- Japanese proverb (Ch. 2)
- Type: Mechanism | Layer: 1

### M-03: Why Liking Works
The halo effect: one positive trait (attractiveness, similarity, flattery) colors judgment of all other traits. We automatically assign good-looking people "talent, kindness, honesty, agreeableness, trustworthiness, and intelligence."
> "People just don't sue the doctors they like." (Ch. 3)
- Type: Mechanism | Layer: 1

### M-04: Why Social Proof Works -- Three Reasons
1. **Validity**: If many others do it, it must be the right choice.
2. **Feasibility**: If many others can do it, I probably can too.
3. **Social Acceptance**: Following the majority avoids "the pain of independence" (amygdala activation when defying consensus).
- Type: Mechanism | Layer: 1

### M-05: Why Authority Works
Deep-seated socialization from birth: "obedience to proper authority is right and disobedience is wrong." Authorities usually do have superior information. The shortcut works most of the time.
> "It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that constitutes the chief finding of the study." -- Milgram (Ch. 5)
- Type: Mechanism | Layer: 1

### M-06: Why Scarcity Works -- Two Reasons
1. **Quality heuristic**: Scarce items are typically more valuable (availability as shortcut to quality) combined with loss aversion.
2. **Psychological reactance**: When freedoms are restricted, we want them more. Strongest during "terrible twos" and teenage years, but present throughout life.
> "People assign more value to opportunities that are less available." (Ch. 6)
- Type: Mechanism | Layer: 1

### M-07: Why Commitment/Consistency Works -- Three Sources
1. **Social value**: Consistency is valued by society; inconsistency is seen as untrustworthy.
2. **Practical benefit**: Consistent behavior reduces decision-making load.
3. **Identity alignment**: After committing, people shift self-image to align, then act from the new self-image.
> "Commitments are most effective when they are active, public, effortful, and viewed as internally motivated." (Ch. 7)
- Type: Mechanism | Layer: 1

### M-08: Why Unity Works
Evolutionary advantage: "We"-groups favoring member welfare over outsiders increases group survival. Members use fellow members' preferences as guides (enhancing solidarity). Shared identity triggers automatic, primal loyalty.
> "The experience of 'we'-ness (unity) with others is about shared identities -- tribe-like categories that individuals use to define themselves and their groups." (Ch. 8)
- Type: Mechanism | Layer: 1

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS & WARNINGS

### AP-01: Fake Social Proof Destroys Trust
Counterfeit reviews, manufactured testimonials, and paid queues get detected. Trust in positive reviews dropped from 72% to 68% (2014-2018) because of mimics.
> "The mimics are undermining our confidence in the worth of the shortcut information we seek." (Ch. 1)
- Type: Anti-Pattern | Layer: 2

### AP-02: The Scarcity-Emotion Trap
Scarcity creates emotional arousal that impairs rational thought. If the copy whips up artificial urgency without substance, post-purchase regret and refund rates spike.
> "Panicky, feverish reactions have no place in wise compliance decisions." (Ch. 6)
- Type: Warning | Layer: 2

### AP-03: The Big Social Proof Mistake
Decrying the frequency of undesirable behavior ("X million people fail to Y") normalizes the behavior via social proof, making it worse.
- Forest theft sign tripled larceny when showing multiple thieves.
- Suicide-prevention programs increased teen consideration of suicide when emphasizing alarming rates.
- Anti-alcohol programs increased perceived drinking norms among teens.
- Type: Anti-Pattern | Layer: 2

### AP-04: Five Stars Is Too Good to Be True
Optimal review rating is 4.2-4.7 stars. Above that, purchasers become suspicious. Presence of some negative reviews increases conversion by 67%.
> "Near-perfect ratings undermine trustworthiness." (Spiegel Research Center, cited Ch. 5)
- Type: Anti-Pattern | Layer: 2

### AP-05: Excessive Initial Request Backfires
In rejection-then-retreat, if the first request is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the tactic fails. The requester appears to bargain in bad faith.
> "The truly gifted negotiator is one whose initial position is exaggerated just enough to allow for a series of small reciprocal concessions." (Ch. 2)
- Type: Warning | Layer: 2

### AP-06: Authority Without Substance
People respond to symbols of authority (titles, clothing, trappings) even without substance. But if the fakery is discovered, backlash is severe.
- An actor playing a doctor on TV was more persuasive than the product's actual merits warranted.
- "I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV" worked -- until it didn't.
- Type: Warning | Layer: 2

### AP-07: Coerced Commitment Does Not Last
Commitments made under external pressure (threats, massive rewards) do not produce lasting internal change because they don't alter self-image.
> "Commitments are most effective when they are... viewed as internally motivated (voluntary)." (Ch. 7)
- Type: Anti-Pattern | Layer: 2

### AP-08: Unity Exploited by Profiteers
"We"-ness can be weaponized. Once inside a "we"-group, bad actors exploit loyalty. Corporate "we" language in ethics codes actually increased lying and cheating.
> "Members of these groups favor the outcomes and welfare of fellow members over those of nonmembers" -- including protecting unethical behavior. (Ch. 8)
- Type: Warning | Layer: 2

### AP-09: Liking Manipulation Detected
When people realize undue liking has been manufactured (fake similarities, hollow flattery), they mentally separate the person from the offer. The defense: "In the forty-five minutes I've known this guy, have I come to like him more than I would have expected?"
- Type: Warning | Layer: 2

### AP-10: Social Proof Cascades Can Be Based on Nothing
Singapore bank run started because bus strike created a crowd at the bus stop near the bank. Passersby assumed the crowd was withdrawing funds. The bank was forced to close.
> "We seem to assume that if a lot of people are doing the same thing, they must know something we don't." (Ch. 4)
- Type: Warning | Layer: 2

---

## 5. CONCRETE EXAMPLES

### EX-01: The Turquoise Jewelry Store (Ch. 1)
Items wouldn't sell at low price. Employee accidentally doubled the price instead of halving it. Everything sold immediately. The "expensive = good" shortcut.

### EX-02: The Regan Experiment -- Coke and Raffle Tickets (Ch. 2)
Joe gave subjects a 10-cent Coke. Later asked them to buy raffle tickets. Those who received the Coke bought twice as many -- 500% ROI. Liking for Joe was irrelevant; the reciprocity rule overwhelmed personal preference.

### EX-03: The Boy Scout and Chocolate Bars (Ch. 2)
Boy asked Cialdini to buy $5 circus tickets. Refused. Boy then asked for $1 chocolate bars. Cialdini bought two -- rejection-then-retreat in action.

### EX-04: The Watergate Break-In (Ch. 2)
Liddy's first plan: $1 million (rejected). Second: $500,000 (rejected). Third: $250,000 (approved). Mitchell approved the "bare-bones" plan that was still absurd -- because relative to the first proposals, it seemed reasonable.

### EX-05: Joe Girard's "I Like You" Cards (Ch. 3)
World's greatest car salesman sent 13,000+ customers "I like you" cards monthly. 150,000+ cards per year. It wasn't personal. Everyone knew it. It still worked.

### EX-06: Beijing Restaurant "Most Popular" Labels (Ch. 4)
Simply labeling menu items as "most popular" increased sales 13-20%. Costless, ethical, never before used by the managers.

### EX-07: The Petrified Forest Signs (Ch. 4)
Sign showing multiple thieves: tripled theft to 7.92%. Sign showing lone thief: reduced theft to 1.67%. The Big Mistake demonstrated.

### EX-08: Milgram's Obedience Experiment (Ch. 5)
65% of subjects delivered maximum (450V) shock to a screaming, pleading person on authority's command. 95% of nurses obeyed a fake phone order to administer double the maximum dose of an unauthorized drug.

### EX-09: Waiter Vincent (Ch. 5)
Argued against his own interest by recommending cheaper dishes. Built trust. Then steered wine and dessert choices to expensive items. Combined reciprocity + authority + trustworthiness.

### EX-10: Starbucks Free Vouchers (Ch. 2)
Required customers to publicly thank the company on social media to accept free vouchers. Engaged reciprocity (free gift) + scarcity (dwindling availability) + commitment (public thank-you).

### EX-11: Sylvan Goldman's Shopping Cart (Ch. 4)
Invented the shopping cart but nobody used it. Posted signs, nothing. Finally hired fake shoppers to push carts through the store. Real customers followed. Died with $400M estate.

### EX-12: The Tupperware Party (Ch. 3)
Deploys all seven principles simultaneously. The hostess (liking/friendship) is the real salesperson. Social bond is twice as likely to determine purchase as product preference.

### EX-13: Domino's "We Sucked" Campaign (Ch. 5)
Admitted past poor pizza quality. Sales and stock price soared. Weakness-first trustworthiness in action.

### EX-14: Netflix Revealing Popularity Data (Ch. 4)
After years of secrecy, Netflix began sharing what was popular. Internal tests confirmed: telling members what shows were popular made them more popular. "Popularity precipitates popularity."

### EX-15: The Werther Effect (Ch. 4)
Front-page suicide stories produce average 58 additional suicides. Copycat effect mirrors victim demographics: young victim → young imitators; old victim → old imitators. Even disguised as "accidents" in cars and planes.

## 6. AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

### AI-01: Principle Selection Decision Tree

```
START: What is the primary barrier to conversion?
  |
  v
Audience doesn't know what to choose?
  YES -> SOCIAL PROOF (show what similar others choose)
  |     + AUTHORITY (expert recommendation)
  NO -> continue
  |
Audience doesn't trust the offer?
  YES -> AUTHORITY (weakness-first, then credentials)
  |     + SOCIAL PROOF (verified buyer reviews)
  NO -> continue
  |
Audience feels no connection to the brand?
  YES -> LIKING (similarity, compliments, shared values)
  |     + UNITY (shared identity, "we"-language, co-creation)
  NO -> continue
  |
Audience procrastinating / no urgency?
  YES -> SCARCITY (deadlines, limited availability)
  |     + COMMITMENT (get a small yes first)
  NO -> continue
  |
Audience interested but not acting?
  YES -> COMMITMENT (foot-in-the-door, get micro-commitment)
  |     + RECIPROCITY (give something first)
  NO -> continue
  |
Audience resistant / skeptical of all marketing?
  YES -> Lead with UNITY (shared identity) or LIKING (genuine rapport)
  |     Then layer AUTHORITY (credible expert)
  |     Then SOCIAL PROOF (peer-suasion from similar others)
  NO -> continue
  |
Default: Stack RECIPROCITY (value first) + SOCIAL PROOF + AUTHORITY
```

### AI-02: Persuasion Checklist (Pre-Writing)

Before writing any persuasive copy:

- [ ] **Identify primary barrier**: Which of the 7 principles addresses it?
- [ ] **Select 2-3 principles to stack**: Primary + supporting
- [ ] **Gather honest evidence**: Real numbers, genuine testimonials, true scarcity
- [ ] **Check for Big Mistakes**: Are you accidentally normalizing bad behavior?
- [ ] **Plan the weakness-first move**: What minor flaw can you acknowledge early?
- [ ] **Identify peer group**: Who are the "similar others" for this audience?
- [ ] **Map the commitment ladder**: What small yes leads to the big yes?
- [ ] **Verify ethical compliance**: Are all claims honest? All scarcity real? All proof genuine?

### AI-03: Ethical Application Rules

1. **Never fabricate social proof.** No fake testimonials, manufactured reviews, or paid queues.
2. **Never create artificial scarcity.** If it's not genuinely limited, don't say it is.
3. **Never exploit reciprocity with sham gifts.** Give real value, not compliance traps.
4. **Never fake authority credentials.** Display only genuine expertise.
5. **Never coerce commitments.** Voluntary commitments create lasting change; forced ones create resentment.
6. **Always use the Cialdini test:** Would you be comfortable if the prospect fully understood the technique being used? If not, don't use it.
> "Favors are to be met with favors; it does not require that tricks be met with favors." (Ch. 2)

### AI-04: Principle Stacking Patterns

**High Trust Stack** (skeptical audience):
Authority (weakness-first) -> Social Proof (peer testimonials) -> Scarcity (deadline)

**Relationship Stack** (cold audience):
Reciprocity (free value) -> Liking (similarity) -> Unity (shared identity) -> Commitment (small yes)

**Urgency Stack** (procrastinating audience):
Social Proof (trending popularity) -> Scarcity (limited time) -> Commitment (micro-action)

**Premium Stack** (high-value offer):
Authority (expert endorsement) -> Social Proof (selective peer-suasion) -> Scarcity (exclusivity) -> Unity ("join the elite")

### AI-05: Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify:

1. **Principle Audit**: Can you identify at least 2 principles at work in the copy?
2. **Social Proof Check**: Are testimonials from similar others? Are popularity claims honest?
3. **Authority Check**: Is expertise relevant? Is trustworthiness established (weakness-first)?
4. **Scarcity Check**: Is the limitation genuine? Will the reader feel manipulated later?
5. **Consistency Check**: Does the copy build toward a commitment? Is there a clear small first step?
6. **Big Mistake Check**: Does any claim accidentally normalize undesirable behavior?
7. **Contrast Check**: Is the offer presented after a higher-priced anchor?
8. **Reciprocity Check**: Does the prospect receive value before being asked for action?
9. **Unity Check**: Does the copy establish shared identity where appropriate?
10. **Liking Check**: Does the brand voice mirror the audience's language and values?
