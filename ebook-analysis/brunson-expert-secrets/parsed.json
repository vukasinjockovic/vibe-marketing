A few years back, we had a conversation about belief, and what’s possible when someone truly believes in something. We then talked about how we could create that true belief in the minds of the people we were trying to serve. That one conversation took me on a journey that lasted for more than five years and has resulted in this book. You will see many things I learned that day and over the next few years from Daegan woven into these pages. Without his ideas, this book wouldn’t have been possible.",

The next month we went to Pittsburgh for the high school national wrestling tournament.

When I launched DotCom Secrets , my mom had a job teaching home economics at the same school as the guidance counselor. She finished the story, “I took Russell’s new book, marched right into the counselor’s office, and asked if he remembered telling me that my son wasn’t smart enough to go to BYU, and that he would probably fail after the first semester.

I was not someone who you would ever think would be an “expert” in anything. I graduated college with a stunning 2.3 cumulative GPA.

It wasn’t until the middle of my college career that I started to get exposed to different ideas that they didn’t talk about in school. Google was in its infancy back then, and as I searched for and found things that sparked my interest, I discovered that reading became fun. Sleep became a burden as my mind raced with possibilities.

In this book, I want to help take you and your relationship with your audience to the next level: Now that you’ve attracted someone to you, the next level is to lead them where they want to go.

Jay Abraham once said, “People are silently begging to be led,” 2 and I believe that’s very true.

I spent the next few hours with him listening to his beliefs on God based on hundreds of books he had read.

Second, I knew that it didn’t feel right. I wanted to serve some people first and prove that what I teach actually works.\n\n\r\n One of the first things I teach people is to figure out who their dream customer is. I already had an idea about the types of entrepreneurs I wanted to work with. So I started looking around for those people, and soon I met a guy named Drew Canole, the owner of FitLife.tv. He was a super cool guy and had a successful business in a market I cared about. He was someone I thought I could help.\n\n\r\n Eventually, a mutual friend introduced us. I went to Drew’s house and talked with him for a bit. He mentioned some of the things he was struggling with. Then I asked him, “Would you mind if I came back and just worked a day for free to see if I could help?”",

But for now, I just want to see if I can help you.”\n\n\r\n “What’s the catch? What’s in it for you?”\n\n\r\n “There’s no catch. I think what you do is awesome, and it’d be really fun to see if the stuff I do could help you at all.”\n\n\r\n Finally, Drew reluctantly agreed to let me come and serve his business for a day. I think he still thought there was some kind of ulterior motive.\n\n\r\n About a month later, I flew out and met with his whole team. We found that their funnels were making money, but they weren’t profitable. I helped them fix their current funnels, and we helped build a funnel for the upcoming launch of their new supplement, Organifi.",

At the end of it, they launched their new Organifi funnel, which has gone on to make them tens of millions of dollars per year.\n\n\r\n I didn’t ask Drew for this, but in exchange for my help, he made a video for me talking about the transformation his business went through and the results I was able to get for them.

You find yourself wondering, How is this guy so funny? But what you don’t realize is that over the last 10 years of his journey to become a comedian, he would write out 10 jokes, go to the closest dive bar, stand up onstage, and deliver his jokes. He probably watched as one or two of the 10 jokes landed, and the rest bombed. He would then go back home, take the two jokes that landed, and write eight new ones. The next week he would find a new place to perform, deliver his 10 jokes, and find out that only one of his new jokes landed. He then has three jokes in total that landed. He goes back to his apartment and starts the process over again, doing this week after week, year after year, until he’s found his 10 jokes. Now he’s ready.",

But what most people didn’t realize was that a full decade before I wrote that book, I earned that book. I was obsessed with marketing, and I read, watched, and listened to everything I could get my hands on. After that, I tested the concepts and ideas on the little businesses I was creating.

And while you can always recruit a few people into the crazy zone, it’s difficult to get the masses to take action all the way to the left or the right.\n\n\r\n One of my favorite examples of the crazy zone in the weight-loss world comes from a documentary I watched called Eat the Sun . 9 In this movie, they talked about how people can stop eating and just gaze at the sun. Yes, stop eating completely and just look at the sun. Kinda crazy? Well, the documentary did get me to spend a few minutes gazing at the sun, but I’m not crazy enough to give up food 100 percent.

His origin story falls perfectly in the Prolific Zone. One day he was climbing Mount Kailash in Tibet and stopped at a guesthouse to shelter from minus-10-degree weather. He was given a creamy cup of yak butter tea that made him feel amazing. He tried to figure out why he felt so good.

In fact, everything you learn in Sections Two and Three of this book is all about persuasion. But before we get too deep into that, I want you to understand the core foundation of persuasion.\n\n\r\n One of my favorite books on this topic is The One Sentence Persuasion Course by Blair Warren. 13 Blair is a persuasion expert who spent more than a decade studying and using persuasion. During that journey, he broke down exactly how to persuade people into one simple sentence: “People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions, and help them throw rocks at their enemies.”\n\n\r\n When I first read that, it made such a big impact that I wanted to remember it forever.

I included Blair’s explanations because he explains these concepts so masterfully.\n\n\r\n Encourage their dreams: As the leader, it’s vital that you first understand your audience’s dreams, then encourage them inside the new opportunity you are creating for them. Parents often discourage their children’s dreams “for their own good” and attempt to steer them toward more “reasonable” goals. And children often accept this as normal until others come along who believe in them and encourage their dreams.\n\n\r\n When this happens, who do you think has more power? Parents or strangers?",

You will not be the first person they have tried to learn from. For some reason, they didn’t get their needs met from any prior encounters.

And while accepting responsibility is essential to gaining control of one’s own life, assuring others they are not responsible is essential to gaining influence over theirs. One need look no further than politics to see this powerful game played at its best.\n\n\r\n Allay their fears: To allay is to diminish or put to rest.

Hardly. And yet we don’t seem to notice. We go on as if we’ve solved the problem and the person before us fades further away. But there are those who do realize this and pay special attention to our fears. They do not tell us not to be afraid. They work with us until our fear subsides. They present evidence.

They want to believe change is possible, but they’re skeptical about making the leap forward. When you can confirm in story format that you had similar suspicions and describe how you overcame them, it will bond people to you.\n\n\r\n One of our favorite things to say is “I knew it.” There is just nothing quite like having our suspicions confirmed. When another person confirms something that we suspect, we not only feel a surge of superiority, we feel attracted to the one who helped make that surge come about. Hitler “confirmed” the suspicions of many Germans about the cause of their troubles and drew them further into his power by doing so.

Not once in those 10 years has a single one of the people who sat in for free launched a successful company. Yet in the same room sat people who invested in themselves. They heard the exact same information and, because they invested money to be there, turned that same information into multimillion-dollar-a-year companies.

Many people think that sharing the source of their knowledge somehow diminishes their status in the minds of the people listening, but the opposite is true. I try to always give credit to the person I learned anything from before I share it. Doing this has helped me keep great relationships with the people I learned from when I got started.

The Farnam Street blog explained the difference between strategy and tactics like this: 15 \n\n\r\n \r\n Strategy is [an] overarching plan or set of goals. Changing strategies is like trying to turn around an aircraft carrier—it can be done but not quickly. Tactics are the specific actions or steps you undertake to accomplish your strategy.

The ad ends with the two together back home.\n\n\r\n After showing the ad, Steve asked the question again a little differently: “What desire was this marketing message created for?”\n\n\r\n Instantly everyone responded, “RELATIONSHIPS!”",

As Steve often says, “If your product doesn’t fit into one of the three core desires, then your sales message at least must!”\n\n\r\n THE SUBMARKETS\n\n\r\n When the markets first started, there were only three. The companies that started to sell their products inside each market had almost no competition. In their book Blue Ocean Strategy , W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne call markets that have no competition “blue oceans.” 16 But eventually other companies see the success they are having in this blue ocean, and they jump in and compete to serve the same market.

Before we ask how passionate the market is, I need to ask you a personal question. Are you irrationally passionate about your topic? When you hang out with friends or family members, do you always bring it up, even if no one else seems to care? If so, that’s a good sign. But are there others as irrationally passionate as you? Here are some of the things I look for to determine if my market is irrationally passionate.\n\n\r\n Communities: Are there online forums, message boards, and social groups dedicated to this topic? How about Facebook groups and fan pages, YouTube channels, podcasts, or blogs with others geeking out on this topic you love so much?",

It’s not necessarily the first, but the category king is the one who was the best marketer and sucked up the lion’s share of the business.

Numerous attempts were made at developing a drag and drop editor for the sales funnel world. However, the three were a powerhouse of unique gifts, and once they created what many others had failed at, the next task was to learn how to sell the new software.\n\n\r\n What most don’t know is that ClickFunnels almost failed. Not because the software wasn’t good, but because they didn’t know how to sell their new product. Russell told me that he had tried to launch ClickFunnels six times before he learned how to sell it.

You wake up, walk out of your hut, put on your sandals, and grab a basket of fish that you are going to sell for the day. As you look out over the village, you see a hillside filled with lots of other huts. Your family is counting on you to sell those fish, and with the distance to the village there’s only enough time for you to set up and sell your fish in one spot today.",

I’ve asked this question on many stages now, and the majority of people respond, “You go wherever there’s the most people!”\n\n\r\n That’s right! You’ll walk to a location where many people are already in the habit of going, otherwise known as a marketplace or market. A market is a place for buyers and sellers to meet and exchange goods and services.\n\n\r\n It’s a mistake to think that the internet is any different from this example. While earning my marketing degree I was commonly asked, “Who is your target market?” However, as my village example now shows, a market is not a person; it’s a location.\n\n\r\n For example, my wife and I live in Boise, Idaho, about three miles south of ClickFunnels HQ. Several times, we’ve gotten up on a Saturday morning, put our three kids in the car, and driven to the Boise Farmers Market downtown.",

It’s more lucrative for me and my business if I simply meet my dream customer at the same market, rather than walk around the village trying to hunt everyone down.\n\n\r\n While your goal is to eventually create your own market, that does take time.

He told me that he wanted to become a real estate expert and teach others what he knew. I was excited, because although I am not in that market, I am friends with two or three dozen people who are. I asked him about some of my friends, names everyone in that industry would know, and he had never heard of any of them. I told him that if I knew his market better than he did, that he was in trouble. My assignment to him was to find 20 or 30 other gurus who were already in his market, consume everything they had to offer,",

He stood in front of the world and told everyone that he wanted to revolutionize the music industry (the submarket within which he was building his category). He talked about the other niches within that submarket: a CD would hold 10–15 songs, an MP3 player would hold about 150 songs, and a heavy hard drive would hold about 1,000 songs. 22 \n\n\r\n And then Jobs did something that every leader of every movement throughout time has done. He did not present them with an “improvement offer” (something that is better, or faster, or almost any word that ends with an “er”). Instead, he created a new category and offered what we call a “new opportunity.”",

He then reached into his back pocket and pulled out the first iPod and showed it to the world. This launched his new category, transformed the music industry forever, and made Apple the category king.\n\n\r\n He followed this same pattern a few years later when he created another new category (smartphones) and revealed to the world Apple’s new new opportunity: the iPhone. Later, he created another new opportunity with the iPad.\n\n\r\n Jobs knew that consumers weren’t looking for a faster CD or a better phone; they wanted something new, so that’s what he created for them.\n\n\r\n When you study any of the successful movements throughout time (both positive and negative), you’ll notice that each of the leaders offered their followers a new opportunity.",

Here are a few of the main reasons people tend to avoid improvement offers at all costs.\n\n\r\n Improvement is hard: Most people have tried to improve in the past, and for some reason it didn’t work. They’ve tried to lose weight. They’ve tried to make money. They’ve tried to make their relationships better. But if they’re coming to you, then whatever they tried in the past didn’t work for some reason. They know the difficulties they’ve had to go through, and there is pain associated with that.\n\n\r\n With a new opportunity, they don’t know what the process will be, so they don’t have to go through the known pain to get the result. Another amazing quote from The True Believer :\n\n\r\n “[Your customers] must be wholly ignorant of the difficulties involved in their vast undertaking. Experience is a handicap.” ",

      "text": " wholly ignorant of the difficulties involved in their vast undertaking. Experience is a handicap.” \n\n\r\n Desire vs. ambition: All people have desire, but very few have ambition. My guess is that less than 2 percent of the population is actually ambitious. Improvement offers are selling to overachieving, ambitious people. If you do sell an improvement offer, you are automatically excluding 98 percent of the world. You will be fighting an uphill battle. A new opportunity, on the other hand, plays on people’s desires for the change they want in their lives.",

In order for them to say yes to your offer, they have to admit that the choices they made in the past were wrong. No one wants to admit when they’re wrong, yet an improvement offer forces them to admit they’ve failed. Remember the One Sentence Persuasion Course from earlier in the book? We want to justify their past failures. A new opportunity does that.\n\n\r\n Commodity pricing: When you are selling improvement, you are selling against dozens or hundreds of other improvement offers out there. You are stuck in the middle of a very red ocean, competing with everyone else who is selling similar options. This competition turns what you do into a commodity and pushes the pricing down. It quickly becomes a race to the bottom in terms of pricing.",

And you can’t do that when you are fighting inside this red ocean. When you present a new opportunity, you are creating a blue ocean, and all price resistance goes out the window.\n\n\r\n But the biggest reason people don’t want improvement offers is so important that I wanted to write a separate section about it. The number one reason people don’t want improvement, and the reason they will or won’t buy, is status .\n\n\r\n STATUS: THE ONLY THING THAT CAUSES PEOPLE TO MOVE (OR NOT MOVE)",

Status is the magic word in this business.

We’re balancing hope of increased status against fear of decreased status. If you’re selling a weight-loss solution and someone has tried and failed on 27 different diets, that fear is going to be pretty high. You’re going to have to work pretty hard to get the sale.\n\n\r\n If your brain thinks that taking an action will reverse your status, then you won’t do it— unless it finds hope that by temporarily decreasing your status (spending money to try your new opportunity), you could increase it in the future.

So you can probably see why that is the biggest reason we don’t sell improvement offers.

Some doctors and scientists said it wasn’t just hard or dangerous but physically impossible. No one could run a mile in under four minutes. 28 \n\n\r\n Then, on a cold, rainy day (May 6, 1954), six men entered a race held on the Iffley Road track in Oxford, England. 29 One of these men was Roger Bannister.

Campbell had spent his life studying the universal themes and archetypes (and what I would call frameworks) that are present in storytelling across history and across the world. In his studies, he found that the framework was present in mythical stories regardless of the time in history or the culture in which it was set. Almost all successful stories throughout time followed a 17-stage framework.\n\n\r\n In 1949, Campbell wrote a book detailing his findings called The Hero with a Thousand Faces . 37 In it, he laid out his 17-stage story framework, which he called the “The Hero’s Adventure”:\n\n\r\n \r\n The Call to Adventure: Hero receives calling to the unknown",

In an interview, he said that after he had Campbell’s framework he was “able to take ideas that go through all societies, through all the ages, and bring them down and put them into a razzle-dazzle . . . action-adventure film.” 38 \n\n\r\n Over the next few years they became great friends, even though, shockingly, Campbell had yet to see any of the Star Wars films. Lucas invited him to come and watch the shows with him. This was decades before people ever binge-watched movies, and Lucas said “it was actually the first time anybody had ever seen all three of [the movies] together at one time.” They watched the whole trilogy in a day. When the last film ended, they sat quietly in the dark, and then Campbell said, “You know, I thought real art had stopped with Picasso, Joyce, and Mann.",

So I started digging deeper to find ways to simplify that framework into something I could use.\n\n\r\n During my journey trying to figure out how to use stories better in my marketing, I came across the Christopher Vogler book The Writer’s Journey . While he was working as an executive at Disney, he took Campbell’s framework and figured out how to simplify it to fit into film.

I asked Mike how he was doing, and he told me that business was better than ever before. Confused, I asked him how, and then he gave me the big aha. He told me that he had added one step to his website that changed everything. He said that it was similar to how McDonald’s works. After you order a Big Mac, they ask if you would also like fries and a Coke. After someone bought one of his products, he added an upsell page asking them if they wanted to buy one of his other products at a discount.",

He said that one out of three people who bought his first product ended up buying his upsell as well! Because of that he was making more money from each customer and he could now afford to keep paying Google for traffic.\n\n\r\n I got so excited. I quickly tried to find something that I could add as an upsell after people bought my potato gun DVD. I found a company that sold potato gun kits, and I worked out a deal where I could sell the kits and they would ship them to the customer. I added that upsell, created my very first funnel, and just like Mike said, one out of three people who bought my DVD ended up buying the potato gun kit! I made enough money to pay for the Google ads and keep a hefty profit!",

I got so excited by the secret I had discovered that I wanted to see if it would also work for other products. Soon I launched funnels selling weight-loss products, dating advice, couponing classes, network marketing, iPhone apps, supplements for people with diabetic neuropathy, and more. I found that some of the funnels I created worked better for online businesses and others worked better for service-based businesses.

Go back to that time and place and remember the circumstances that caused you to start on your hero’s journey. Usually this backstory starts at about the same point where your listener is in their life right now.\n\n\r\n They desire the same result that you have already achieved. But when they see you as the expert and see what you’ve accomplished, it can be hard for them to relate to you and trust you.

Because your audience also shares these same internal struggles. Most people never talk about them, but when the audience hears you get vulnerable and expose what you are really struggling with, they will form an almost instant connection with you.\n\n\r\n When you get to the end of the story, typically you’ve solved the external struggles and accomplished what the hero has set out to do.

If they already had the correct story in their mind, they would have already achieved their desired result. Our job as a marketer and a storyteller is to rewrite that story.\n\n\r\n HOW WE REWRITE THEIR STORY\n\n\r\n The first thing you have to understand is how people write their stories and create their beliefs. It all starts with an experience that happened in their life. It could be positive or negative, but immediately after they have that experience, their mind quickly creates a story about what that experience meant. Their brain then takes the story they’ve created and it becomes a belief.",

These belief systems form the foundations for our lives. We create these beliefs to keep us safe and to safeguard our status. And while they’ve been developed to protect us, oftentimes they’re also the things that keep us from progressing in our lives.\n\n\r\n \n\n\r\n Figure 10.1: When people have a bad experience, they create a story that they tell themselves; this story holds them back with “chains” of false belief. \n\n\r\n This process has been happening every day of your life and has created you and the belief systems you hold on to today.

If you are standing in the back of the room and you are looking at the heads of the audience members, it looks like the waves in the ocean going up and down.

It’s an amplifier. If they only see one video and then they attend the webinar, that’s okay. Videos two and three may come after the webinar, and that’s fine. Don’t stress about it. Oftentimes one of the indoctrination emails is the thing that gets them to watch a replay or to purchase after the webinar is over.\n\n\r\n Step 4: Send Reminders\n\n\r\n The reminders start on Wednesday. Just send quick emails and/ or text messages that say something like: “Hey, don’t forget we’re talking about ________ live tomorrow at ________ .” People don’t always read every email, so I like to send one the day before we go live, one the morning of the webinar, one an hour or so before we start, another about 15 minutes before, then a final one that says, “We’re live—join us!”\n\n\r\n Step 5: Present the Webinar Live",

Others might prefer Tuesdays or Wednesdays, but that matters less than following the pre-webinar indoctrination series, the Perfect Webinar framework, and the follow-up sequences.\n\n\r\n ClickFunnels doesn’t have its own webinar platform. It will build all the pages for registration, indoctrination, order forms, etc., but the webinar must be delivered live on a webinar platform. The two we use are GoToWebinar.com and Zoom.us.

I schedule my webinars during the day because most people in my market are entrepreneurs who usually have more freedom over their schedules during the day. Other markets where people have 9-to-5 jobs usually require nighttime webinars. So when you present the webinar will depend on your particular audience.\n\n\r\n Typically, about 25 percent of registrants show up on the webinar. If fewer than 25 percent attend, focus more on the indoctrination sequence, sending text message reminders before the webinar, emails one hour before the webinar, and again 15 minutes before.

At first, it will probably be pretty low. That’s why you need to do your presentation live so many times. When you have a 5 percent close rate, you have a good webinar and are likely going to be profitable on the front end. When you get it to 10 percent, then (I believe) you have a million-dollar-a-year webinar. When you get above 10 percent . . . well, I’ll tell you that at 15 percent, we did just shy of $10 million the first year.

Going live on Facebook or Instagram can be intimidating when you are trying to remember a script, and people in comments can be brutal.

In DotCom Secrets , I talked about a concept I learned from André Chaperon called Soap Opera Sequences (SOS), which are the emails you send to someone when they first join your list. 47 He called them Soap Opera Sequences because each email ends with a hook that draws you to the next episode, just like a soap opera does.",

But when I started seeing people use the Perfect Webinar in different situations like Facebook Live and video sales letters, I had a thought . . . I wonder if this would also work as an email sequence? In fact, I wonder if I could do all the selling by email, and not even direct people into attending a presentation. It seemed so crazy, I figured it just might work. So I took the Perfect Webinar and broke down the four core stories and the Stack, added each into an email, and tested it out. The results were amazing! So much so that we are now going back and adding them into every funnel we have.\n\n\r\n \n\n\r\n Figure 19.2: You can use the Perfect Webinar framework in your follow-up sequences. ",

The first was writing out each story for the emails. The second was making videos telling each story and linking to the video inside the emails. Honestly, the way you transmit the story matters less than following the actual story structure.\n\n\r\n One of the keys to a soap opera sequence like this is that every email needs to pull people into the story in the next email. Think about how good soap operas, reality shows, and most TV shows are able to pull you through the commercial breaks and week to week by getting you excited by what is about to happen, then cutting it off. We do the same thing in these emails, teasing about the next email that’s coming so they are anxiously waiting for it.",

(At the time, I had built a duct tape mess of a sales funnel with Kajabi, Infusionsoft, Leadpages, OptimizePress, WordPress, and Zapier. It was a ticking time bomb, but I had finally, after investing well over $200,000 in consultants, managed to get all the software to sort of work together as a junkyard dog of a sales funnel.)\n\n\r\n I told my client, “No, I haven’t heard of ClickFunnels, nor am I interested in adding yet another software to the huge mess I have already created!”",

You see, about a year earlier I had launched my first book, DotCom Secrets , which taught people how to grow their companies online with sales funnels.

The hook is how you grab your dream customer’s attention, the story is how you build up the perceived value of what you sell, and the offer is what you are selling. I then showed how each page in your funnel has a hook, a story, and an offer: your ads, emails, social media posts, blog posts, podcast episodes, landing pages, sales pages, upsell pages, and more. Everything you put into the world has these three elements, and if something is not working, it’s always either your hook, your story, or your offer.",

The higher the perceived value of your offer is, the easier it will be to sell it. If your potential customers see your offer and feel it’s worth $1,000, and you are only selling it for $100, they will buy it every time. But if they think it’s worth $50, and you are selling it for $100, you will never make the sale. The secret is to get the perceived value to be more than the actual cost. When you can do this, people always say yes. Here are a few things we have done to increase the perceived value of our offer so far:\n\n\r\n \r\n We changed what we sell from an improvement offer to a new opportunity.\n\n\r\n We developed proprietary frameworks that are unique to us.",

He told me he was hosting his new “10X Event” in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay, where 9,000 business owners and salespeople would be attending, and wanted to know if I’d be one of his keynote speakers.\n\n\r\n Nine thousand people?! I didn’t even know it was possible to get that many to attend an event like that. But I told him, “Sure, if you can pull off getting 9,000 people there, I’ll come and speak.”\n\n\r\n “How much would you charge for that?” he asked.\n\n\r\n I told him, “I want to make at least one million dollars if I’m going to leave my family for a weekend and come speak.”\n\n\r\n There were about five seconds of silence, and then I could hear him audibly laughing into the phone at me. “Russell, there is no way we’re gonna pay you even a fraction of that!”",

(If only he knew then how much that one speech would generate . . . ha ha!)\n\n\r\n The deal was made, and after I hung up the phone, I told my team that we had a new goal.

And then, slide by slide, I delivered my presentation. Just as we had agreed, at the end of the presentation I made a special offer to the audience. As soon as I made the offer, people jumped out of their chairs. They stampeded their way up the stairs and around the corner to our product tables.\n\n\r\n The next six hours were a whirlwind. I stood in line taking pictures with each person who bought my product!
