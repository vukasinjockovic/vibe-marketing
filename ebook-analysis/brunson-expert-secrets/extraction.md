## DECISION RULES

### DR-001: New Opportunity vs Improvement
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

IF the offer is positioned as an improvement on what the prospect already does
THEN reposition as a New Opportunity (opportunity switch)

> "Don't try to make a better mousetrap. Instead, come up with a completely new opportunity that makes the mousetrap obsolete."
> -- Secret #4

**Rationale:** Improvement offers force the prospect to admit past failure, which decreases status. New opportunities create hope without judgment.

---

### DR-002: Strategy vs Tactics (Selling vs Teaching)
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF the context is SELLING (webinar, VSL, sales page, ad)
THEN teach the WHAT (strategy) but NOT the HOW (tactics)

IF the context is TEACHING (course, coaching, fulfillment)
THEN teach Story -> Strategy -> Tactics -> Social Proof

> "When you are selling, you do not teach the tactics. You teach the what (strategy) but not the how. Your audience's desire for the how is the reason they are going to give you money at the end of your presentation."
> -- Secret #11

---

### DR-003: One Big Domino Per Presentation
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF the sales message asks the prospect to believe more than ONE core thing
THEN simplify to one Big Domino belief

> "He discovered that the more things they asked someone to believe in their sales pitch, the worse the offer converted. In fact, he figured out that if they tried to make more than one point or ask someone to focus on more than one thing in a sales message, conversion rates dropped by half!"
> -- Perry Belcher, quoted in Secret #12

---

### DR-004: Story Before Framework
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF you are about to teach a framework or present information
THEN tell the story of how you learned or earned it FIRST

> "Without this preframe, your audience won't value the gold that you are about to give them."
> -- Secret #13

---

### DR-005: Status as Buying Motivator
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

IF choosing how to position an offer
THEN ask: "Will the prospect believe this increases their perceived status?"

> "Every buying decision is based on status: Will this increase or decrease my perceived status?"
> -- Secret #4

---

### DR-006: Stack Format for Offers
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF presenting an offer with multiple components
THEN use the Stack format (cumulative slide, last thing shown = complete offer)

> "The only thing prospects remember when you sell is the last thing you show them."
> -- Armand Morin, quoted in Secret #14

---

### DR-007: Expert as Guide, Not Hero
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

IF positioning the expert/brand in any content
THEN position as the Guide (Yoda, Mickey, Gandalf), NOT the Hero

> "In Building a StoryBrand, Donald Miller explains that your brand is not the hero. He says your customer is the hero, and your brand's role is to successfully guide the hero through the challenges they will face."
> -- Secret #16

---

### DR-008: Urgency/Scarcity Always
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF making any offer via webinar, VSL, or presentation
THEN include urgency and/or scarcity

> "Do not skip this part! It is the key to getting people to buy immediately. If they leave the webinar, the chances of them coming back and buying later are almost zero."
> -- Secret #14

---

### DR-009: Oversimplification Principle
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF explaining a concept to a prospect
THEN simplify to 5th-8th grade level and use "kinda like" bridges

> "Most presidential candidates speak at grade 6-8 level."
> -- Cited in Secret #7

Use analogy: "It's kinda like [familiar concept]" to bridge unfamiliar ideas to familiar ones.

---

### DR-010: Trial Closes After Every Story
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF you just shared a case study, success story, or teaching point
THEN pause and stack 3-6 trial closes before moving on

> "If you are standing in the back of the room and you are looking at the heads of the audience members, it looks like the waves in the ocean going up and down."
> -- Ted Thomas, quoted in Secret #15

---

### DR-011: False Beliefs Before Copy
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF you are about to write any persuasive content
THEN first map all false beliefs across three categories:
1. Vehicle false beliefs (about the new opportunity)
2. Internal false beliefs (about the prospect's ability)
3. External false beliefs (about outside forces blocking them)

Then create Epiphany Bridge stories for each.

---

### DR-012: Prolific Zone Positioning
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF positioning an expert's voice/brand
THEN aim for the "Prolific Zone" between mainstream and crazy

Too mainstream = boring, no true fans, no polarity
Too crazy = dismissed, marginalized, unrelatable
Prolific Zone = strong opinions that attract true fans while being accessible

> "The person you are becoming is being built on the backs of the experiences and frameworks that are coming in your future."
> -- Secret #1

---

### DR-013: Opportunity Switch vs Opportunity Stack
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF the prospect is at the front of the value ladder (first purchase)
THEN use an Opportunity SWITCH (replace their current vehicle entirely)

IF the prospect is ascending the value ladder (repeat buyer)
THEN use an Opportunity STACK (add tools/methods within the same opportunity)

> "There should be only one opportunity switch, and it should happen at the time they buy your front-end offer."
> -- Secret #5

---

### DR-014: Buying Creates Commitment
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

IF debating whether to offer something for free or paid
THEN prefer paid (even low price) because buying creates commitment

> "I honestly believe that the greatest service you can provide for someone is getting them to buy something. The act of buying creates a commitment that causes someone to take action."
> -- Secret #13

---

### DR-015: Framework Teaching Format
**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF teaching a framework in any context
THEN follow this 4-step sequence:
1. Give the framework a proprietary name
2. Tell the story of how you learned or earned it
3. Teach the strategy (the what)
4. Show results (yours + others')

IF selling, stop after strategy (no tactics)
IF teaching, continue to tactics after strategy

> "Step 1: Introduce the framework name. Step 2: Share how you learned or earned it. Step 3: Teach the strategy. Step 4: Show social proof."
> -- Secret #2

---

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

```

  - To STOP (prevent bad things from happening)
```

> -- Secret #8

---

## PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### P-001: Experience -> Story -> Belief
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 0-foundational

People have experiences. They create stories about those experiences. Those stories become beliefs. Beliefs drive all behavior.

To change behavior, you must rewrite the story, which rewrites the belief.

> "It all starts with an experience that happened in their life. It could be positive or negative, but immediately after they have that experience, their mind quickly creates a story about what that experience meant. Their brain then takes the story they've created and it becomes a belief."
> -- Secret #10

---

### P-002: Emotion First, Logic Second
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

Purchasing decisions are made emotionally and justified logically.

> "We make our purchasing decisions based on emotion, and then we use logic to justify those decisions."
> -- Secret #7

Stories create emotional connection. Frameworks and data provide logical justification afterward.

---

### P-003: Status Is the Only Motivator
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

> "Every buying decision is based on status: Will this increase or decrease my perceived status?"
> -- Secret #4

Two dimensions:
- Status in their own eyes
- Status in the eyes of people whose opinions they value

This is why improvement offers fail -- they require admitting the old way failed (status decrease).

---

### P-004: The Big Domino (Modus Ponens)
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

Based on the logical form modus ponens: If A, then B. A. Therefore B.

> "If the Bible is true, then Jesus is the Savior. The Bible is true. Therefore, Jesus is the Savior."
> -- Secret #12

In marketing: If they believe the ONE THING (Big Domino), all objections become irrelevant. Everything in your presentation exists only to support that one belief from different angles.

---

### P-005: Category King Economics
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

From "Play Bigger": Category kings take 70-80% of the profits in their category.

> "If you are not first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in."
> -- Al Ries, cited in Secret #3

Don't compete in an existing niche. Create your own sub-niche and become its king.

---

### P-006: The Two Journeys
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

Every hero has two simultaneous journeys:
1. **Journey of Achievement** (external, visible goal)
2. **Journey of Transformation** (internal, identity change)

The transformation journey is what actually creates lasting connection.

> "It's not the achievement that really matters, it's the transformation -- who the hero became -- that makes the story resonate."
> -- Secret #8

---

### P-007: The Prolific Index
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 2-strategic

Three zones for expert positioning:
- **Mainstream Zone:** Safe, boring, no true fans, low polarity
- **Prolific Zone:** Strong opinions backed by frameworks; attracts true fans and repels others
- **Crazy Zone:** Too extreme, dismissed by the market

Goal: Stay in the Prolific Zone. Be bold enough to be interesting, grounded enough to be credible.

---

### P-008: Five Phases of Becoming an Expert
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

1. **Dreamer:** Has passion but no skills yet
2. **Reporter:** Researches and interviews others with expertise
3. **Framework Creator:** Synthesizes what they've learned into proprietary frameworks
4. **Servant:** Serves people using their frameworks, getting results
5. **Expert/Guide:** Has enough experience and results to guide others on their journey

> -- Secret #1

---

### P-009: The Value Ladder
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 2-strategic

Customers ascend through increasing levels of value and price:
- Free/low-cost front-end (lead magnet, free+shipping book)
- Mid-tier (courses, group coaching)
- High-ticket (mastermind, 1-on-1 coaching)
- Continuity (membership, software)

Each step uses funnels with appropriate presentation formats.

---

### P-010: Stories as Keys to Belief
**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

> "If I can identify people's false beliefs and tell stories that show them the truth, I don't need to 'sell' them anything. The stories lead people to the right belief, and they sell themselves."
> -- Secret #10

---

### P-011: The Stack Psychology
**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 2-strategic

People only remember the LAST thing you show them. Traditional offers show: Core -> Bonus 1 -> Bonus 2 -> Bonus 3. Prospect anchors on Bonus 3's value.

The Stack solves this by building cumulatively on ONE slide, so the last thing shown is the COMPLETE offer with FULL value.

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS & WARNINGS

### AP-001: Teaching Kills Sales
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

> "What I discovered from the best people in the business was that teaching the best content hurts sales."
> -- Secret #11

In a selling context, don't teach tactics. Teach strategy (the what) only. Tactics are what they pay for.

---

### AP-002: Free Guests Never Succeed
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

> "Dozens of my friends have come to my events as free guests, where someone sitting next to them had paid $50,000 to be in the same room. The strange thing is that so far none of these friends have ever launched successful businesses from the info they got at the event. None. Yet for those who paid to be in the room, our success rate is almost 100 percent."
> -- Secret #13

Commitment through payment drives action. Free information is not valued.

---

### AP-003: First "Yes" = Money
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical

> "The reason I didn't get a table rush was because the first time I asked the audience to say yes was when I was asking for their money."
> -- Ted Thomas, quoted in Secret #15

Fix: Use trial closes throughout so the audience has said yes hundreds of times before the money ask.

---

### AP-004: Multiple Belief Points
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

If you try to get someone to believe 3 different things, conversion drops by HALF per additional point.

Fix: One Big Domino. Everything else supports it from different angles.

---

### AP-005: Logic-First Selling
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

Leading with data, features, specifications, and logical arguments triggers resistance. The analytical mind looks for holes.

Fix: Lead with story (emotion). Supply logic afterward as justification.

---

### AP-006: Improvement Positioning
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

"We're like X but better/faster/cheaper" positions you in a red ocean and forces the prospect to admit the old way failed.

Fix: Create a new category. Be the ONLY option, not a better option.

---

### AP-007: No Backstory
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical

Jumping straight to the framework without backstory means no rapport, no emotional connection, no context for why the framework matters.

Fix: Every framework presentation starts with the Epiphany Bridge story of how you discovered it.

---

### AP-008: Expert as Hero
**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

Positioning yourself as the hero makes the audience feel inferior and creates distance.

Fix: You are the Guide (Yoda to their Luke). The customer is always the hero of their own story.

---

## CONCRETE EXAMPLES

> "Almost anyone could probably close a higher percentage than I could selling one-on-one, but because I'm able to speak to 100 people, or 1,000 people, or 9,000 people all at once, with one speech, and because I know how to craft and structure my presentation, I'm able to make more money in a fraction of the time!"
> -- Secret #11, Section 3 opening

---

### EX-003: Armand Morin's Stack Discovery
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Stack psychology, transformative technique

> "Since that day I have never sold anything without using the Stack."
> -- Secret #14

---

### EX-004: Ted Thomas Trial Close Discovery
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Trial closes, habit of agreement

Ted Thomas ("The Pied Piper of Selling") demonstrated trial closes at lunch with Russell. Russell realized he'd been nodding his head the entire conversation. Added trial closes to an existing automated webinar: revenue jumped from $9.45 to $16.50 per registrant (75% increase) with no other changes.

> -- Secret #15

---

### EX-005: Jason Fladlien Objection Blitz
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** "You're probably thinking X, right?" supporting story technique

Fladlien tracked every objection during a webinar. After the main presentation, he spent 90 additional minutes breaking ~50 false beliefs using the formula: "You're probably thinking [X], right? Well, [quick story]." Sold 3x more during the blitz than during the main webinar.

Brandon and Kaelin Poulin adopted this technique and more than doubled their webinar sales.

> -- Foreword

---

### EX-007: Bill Glazer's "You're Keeping People from Success"
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Teaching kills sales anti-pattern

Bill Glazer told Russell: "You're keeping people from success because you were teaching them." It took Russell years to understand that over-teaching in a selling context prevents people from committing (buying), and without commitment, they never take action.

> -- Secret #13

---

### EX-008: Russell's First Stage Bomb
**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific
**Demonstrates:** Teaching kills sales; content != conversion

Russell prepared a content-packed presentation to "out-teach" every other speaker. Nobody bought. He hid in his hotel room eating ice cream.

> "I swore that I'd never speak or sell from stage ever again."
> -- Secret #11

Later discovered: breaking beliefs and telling stories converts, not teaching tactics.

1. Is this SELLING or TEACHING?
   -> SELLING: Use strategy-only mode. No tactics in copy.
   -> TEACHING: Full framework mode (story + strategy + tactics + proof)

2. What is the New Opportunity?
   -> If positioned as improvement, STOP and reposition as opportunity switch

3. What is the Big Domino?
   -> Write the one-sentence Big Domino Statement
   -> Everything in the content supports THIS belief from different angles

   -> Vehicle: "This approach won't work"
   -> Internal: "I can't do this"
   -> External: "Something outside me will stop me"

### AI-002: Pre-Writing Checklist

Before writing:
1. Identify the New Opportunity (not improvement)
2. Write the Big Domino statement
3. List all false beliefs (vehicle, internal, external)
4. Prepare Epiphany Bridge stories for each false belief
5. Build the Story Inventory (supporting stories for additional objections)
6. Construct the Stack Slide (total value = 10x price)
7. Prepare trial closes (minimum 10)
8. Identify urgency/scarcity mechanisms
9. Confirm expert is positioned as Guide, not Hero
10. Check that the offer increases perceived status

### AI-003: Writing Rules (Priority Order)

**Must-Follow (Rank 1):**
1. One Big Domino per presentation
2. New Opportunity, not improvement
3. Story before information
4. Strategy only (no tactics) in selling contexts
5. Stack format for all offers
6. Break beliefs with stories, not arguments
7. Expert = Guide, not Hero

**Should-Follow (Rank 2):**
8. Trial closes every 2-3 minutes
9. Build Story Inventory first
10. 5-phase Epiphany Bridge for all stories
11. Urgency and scarcity in every offer
12. Oversimplify; use "kinda like" bridges
13. Address all three false belief types
14. Status-check every offer element

**Nice-to-Have (Rank 3):**
15. "If all" statements before price reveal
16. "Reluctant Hero" frame
17. Weekly webinar testing model
18. 5-Minute version for ads
19. Supporting Epiphany Bridge blitz
20. Prolific Zone positioning

### AI-004: Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify:
1. Can I state the Big Domino in one sentence? If not, simplify.
2. Is this New Opportunity or improvement? Would accepting it require admitting failure?
3. Does every framework have a story before it?
4. Am I teaching WHAT but not HOW (if selling)?
5. Are all three false belief types covered?
6. Is the offer stacked cumulatively (not bonus-by-bonus)?
7. Are there trial closes every 2-3 minutes?
8. Does the reader feel like the hero?
9. Does the offer increase perceived status?
10. Is there genuine urgency/scarcity?
11. Would a non-expert understand every concept?
12. Does every story cover all 5 phases?

### AI-005: Epiphany Bridge Quick Reference

When telling any story:
```
1. START where the listener is now (backstory = their current situation)
2. SHOW the old vehicles that failed (they've tried these too)
3. INTRODUCE the conflict/villain (what's fighting against success)
4. PRESENT the guide + epiphany (the breakthrough moment)
5. REVEAL the new opportunity + framework (strategy only)
6. PROVE with results (yours + others')
7. RESOLVE with achievement + transformation (both journeys)
```

Always end on transformation (who you became), not just achievement (what you got).
