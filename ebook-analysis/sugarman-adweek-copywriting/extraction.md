## 1. DECISION RULES

### DR-01: First Sentence Rule [Layer 2 - Structure]
**IF** you are starting an ad **THEN** make the first sentence extremely short and compelling.
> "Make it short. If you look at many typical JS&A ads, you'll notice that all of my first sentences are so short they almost aren't sentences."
- Examples: "Losing weight is not easy." / "It's you against a computer." / "It's easy." / "It had to happen."

### DR-02: Slippery Slide Maintenance [Layer 2 - Structure]
**IF** a reader has begun reading your copy **THEN** every subsequent element must compel them to read the next element -- no exceptions.
> "Every element in an advertisement must cause that slippery slide effect. The headline must be so powerful and compelling that you must read the subheadline, and the subheadline must be so powerful that you are compelled to read the first sentence."

### DR-03: Buying Environment Match [Layer 2 - Structure]
**IF** selling expensive/premium products **THEN** create a clean, refined, confident environment in copy and layout.
**IF** selling discount/bargain products **THEN** create a busy, price-forward, urgent environment.
> "You wouldn't expect to buy an expensive painting from an Army surplus store and you wouldn't expect to find much of a bargain at Tiffany's."

### DR-04: Harmony / Yes-Nodding [Layer 2 - Structure]
**IF** writing opening paragraphs **THEN** make statements the reader will nod along with -- truthful, obvious, agreeable.
**IF** the reader might disagree with a statement **THEN** do not make it, or reframe it.
> "The moment you get the reader to say 'No' or even 'I really don't believe what he is saying' or 'I don't think that relates to me,' you've lost the reader."

### DR-05: Seeds of Curiosity Placement [Layer 3 - Technique]
**IF** at the end of a paragraph where momentum could slow **THEN** insert a short curiosity seed sentence.
> Examples: "But there's more." / "So read on." / "But I didn't stop there." / "Let me explain." / "Now here comes the good part."

### DR-06: Concept Over Product [Layer 2 - Structure]
**IF** selling any product **THEN** sell the concept, not the product itself.
**EXCEPT** when the product is so new that the product IS the concept.
> "Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept."

### DR-07: Emotional Sell, Logical Justify [Layer 1 - Philosophy]
**IF** writing the main body of copy **THEN** lead with emotional appeal.
**IF** the reader is emotionally hooked **THEN** provide logical justification for the purchase.
> "You sell on emotion, but you justify a purchase with logic."

### DR-08: Simple Product / Complex Explanation [Layer 3 - Technique]
**IF** the product is simple and well-understood **THEN** explain it in a complex, technical way (elevates perceived value).
**IF** the product is complex and unfamiliar **THEN** explain it simply (reduces purchase resistance).
> "You should sell a simple product that is clearly understood by the consumer in a more complicated way and a more complicated product in a very simple way."

### DR-09: Satisfaction Conviction Design [Layer 3 - Technique]
**IF** closing the ad **THEN** provide a satisfaction conviction that goes beyond a normal trial period.
**IF** the reader thinks "They must really believe in their product" or "Are they going to get ripped off?" **THEN** the conviction is strong enough.
> "In the test, the response doubled even though the satisfaction conviction was at the very end of the ad."

### DR-10: Cure Over Prevention [Layer 2 - Structure]
**IF** positioning a product **THEN** always emphasize curative aspects over preventive ones.
**IF** the product is purely preventive **THEN** reframe it as a cure.
> "Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive, unless the preventive is perceived as a cure or the curative aspects of the preventive are emphasized."

### DR-11: Copy Length [Layer 2 - Structure]
**IF** the price is high **THEN** more copy is needed to justify the price and build value.
**IF** the product is unusual **THEN** more copy is needed to explain and build the buying environment.
**IF** the product is simple and cheap **THEN** short copy suffices.
> "Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the action you request."

### DR-12: Personal Communication [Layer 2 - Structure]
**IF** writing any advertisement **THEN** write as one person to another -- use "I," "you," "me."
**IF** possible **THEN** use a byline to enable first-person voice.
> "Every communication should be a personal one, from the writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used."

### DR-13: Anticipate and Answer Objections [Layer 3 - Technique]
**IF** you sense the reader might object to something about the product **THEN** raise the objection yourself and resolve it.
**IF** you ignore an obvious flaw **THEN** the reader will not buy.
> "If you feel that your prospect might raise some objection when you are describing a product, then raise the objection yourself."

### DR-14: Physical Facts Completeness [Layer 3 - Technique]
**IF** selling any tangible product **THEN** include ALL physical dimensions, weight, size, limits, speed.
> "Give readers any excuse not to buy and they won't buy."

### DR-15: Simplicity of Offer [Layer 2 - Structure]
**IF** presenting an offer **THEN** make it as simple as possible -- one product, one price, one action.
**IF** you must offer choices **THEN** limit them drastically.
> The Swiss Army watch A/B split: one model outsold nine models by 3:1 ratio.

### DR-16: Editing Ruthlessness [Layer 3 - Technique]
**IF** editing copy **THEN** (1) eliminate "that" words, (2) edit for rhythm, (3) combine sentences, (4) eliminate unnecessary words, (5) rearrange for better flow.
> "In the editing process, you refine your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words."

### DR-17: Mental Engagement [Layer 3 - Technique]
**IF** writing copy **THEN** do not state everything explicitly -- let the reader's mind work to reach conclusions.
> "The more the mind must work to reach a conclusion that it eventually successfully reaches, the more positive, enjoyable, or stimulating the experience."

### DR-18: Specificity Over Generality [Layer 3 - Technique]
**IF** making a claim **THEN** use specific numbers and facts, not vague generalities.
> "Ninety-two percent of new dentists use and recommend CapSnap Toothpaste" vs. "New dentists everywhere use and recommend CapSnap Toothpaste."

## 2. FORMULAS & TEMPLATES

### The Slippery Slide Structure [Layer 2]
1. **Headline** -- grab attention, create curiosity, compel reading of subheadline
2. **Subheadline** -- expand on headline, compel reading of first sentence (~16 words)
3. **First sentence** -- extremely short, easy, compelling
4. **Second sentence** -- maintain momentum, keep it short
5. **First few paragraphs** -- create buying environment, get reader nodding "yes"
6. **Body copy** -- logical flow anticipating reader questions in sequence
7. **Close** -- offer summary, satisfaction conviction, sense of urgency, ask for the order

### The 15 Axioms
1. Copywriting = mental process reflecting sum total of experiences + specific knowledge
2. All elements exist to get reader to read first sentence
3. First sentence's sole purpose = get reader to read second sentence
4. Layout + first paragraphs = create ideal buying environment
5. Get reader to say yes and harmonize
6. Reader must slide through copy as if on a slippery slide
7. Don't assume constraints that aren't there
8. Keep copy interesting through power of curiosity
9. Never sell a product -- always sell a concept
10. Incubation process = subconscious using all knowledge to solve specific problem
11. Copy should be long enough to cause action
12. Every communication = personal, writer to recipient
13. Ideas should flow logically, anticipating questions face-to-face style
14. Editing = express exactly what you want in fewest words
15. Sell cure not prevention

### Three Emotion Principles
1. Every word has an emotion associated with it and tells a story
2. Every good ad is an emotional outpouring of words, feelings and impressions
3. You sell on emotion, but justify with logic

### 10 Graphic Elements (all designed to get reader to first sentence)
Headline, Subheadline, Photo/Drawing, Caption, Copy, Paragraph Headings, Logo, Price, Response Device, Overall Layout

### 23 Copy Elements Checklist
Typeface, First Sentence, Second Sentence, Paragraph Headings, Product Explanation, New Features, Technical Explanation, Anticipate Objections, Resolve Objections, Gender, Clarity, Cliches, Rhythm, Service, Physical Facts, Trial Period, Price Comparison, Testimonials, Price, Offer Summary, Avoid Saying Too Much, Ease of Ordering, Ask for the Order

### 31 Psychological Triggers
1. Feeling of Involvement or Ownership
2. Honesty
3. Integrity
4. Credibility
5. Value and Proof of Value
6. Justify the Purchase
7. Greed
8. Establish Authority
9. Satisfaction Conviction
10. Nature of Product
11. Nature of Prospect
12. Current Fads
13. Timing

### 7-Step Copy Construction Process
1. **Become expert** on the product/service
2. **Know your prospect** -- motivations, desires, demographics
3. **Write headline and subheadline** -- short headline, ~16-word subheadline, ultra-short first sentence
4. **Write copy** -- emotional outpouring, ignore grammar/spelling, just dump everything
5. **Edit** -- correct spelling, grammar, punctuation; eliminate unnecessary words; tighten
6. **Incubate** -- stop, do something pleasurable, let subconscious process
7. **Final look** -- return with fresh eyes, polish further

### The Fog Index (Readability Formula) [Layer 4]
1. Take 100-125 word sample
2. Count words per sentence
3. Divide total words by sentences = average sentence length
4. Count 3+ syllable words (excluding combinations, proper names, -ed/-es verbs)
5. Divide long words by total words = percentage of long words
6. Add average sentence length + percentage of long words
7. Multiply by 0.4 = grade level

Target: 5th-8th grade for mass market. Best-selling books = 8th-10th grade.

## 3. PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### The Slippery Slide Mechanism [Layer 1]
The core metaphor of the entire book. A steep playground slide coated with grease. Once the reader starts, reading momentum ("reading gravity") carries them through the entire ad. Every element exists to build and maintain this momentum. If a reader reaches 25% of your ad, there is a great probability they will read the entire thing.

### Buying Environment [Layer 1]
The psychological space you create through layout, copy tone, and word choice that predisposes the reader to purchase. Like the art gallery's private room with spotlights and classical music. You control this entirely in print.

### Seeds of Curiosity [Layer 2]
Short sentences at paragraph ends that create forward pull. Equivalent to TV hosts saying "Stay tuned" before commercial breaks. Work subconsciously to maintain slide momentum even when copy slows.

### Concept Selling [Layer 1]
Every product has a unique personality and a unique way of being presented. The job is to find the concept that makes it stand out -- the "Big Idea," "USP," or "positioning." Product = steak; Concept = sizzle.

### Incubation [Layer 2]
After gathering all information and beginning to think about the ad, stop. Do something pleasurable. The subconscious processes millions of permutations. Works best with some pressure (deadlines, ego). Interrupting the process with conscious thinking produces inferior results.

### Emotional Word Power [Layer 3]
Every word carries emotional weight beyond its dictionary definition. "Farmer" evokes honesty, integrity, hard work. "Soviet" sounds more sinister than "Russian." "Cottage" feels warmer than "motel." Changing a single word can alter response by 20%+ (Caples: "fix" vs. "repair").

### Linking [Layer 2]
Relating what the consumer already knows to what you're selling. Creates a mental bridge. "The Nose" for a smoke detector. "Pocket CB" for a walkie-talkie. "Mafia Auto Gadget" for a remote car starter. Makes new products instantly comprehensible.

### Consistency / Commitment [Layer 2]
Once a small commitment is made, the tendency is to act consistently with it. First sale should be simple and small. Then upsell. Car dealer technique: sign paperwork, then "You do want the undercoating, don't you?"

### The Nature of Products [Layer 2]
Every product has an inherent nature that determines how it should be sold. Burglar alarm = serious, reliability-focused, easy-install. Toy = fun, excitement. Blood pressure unit = serious medical. You must discover and honor this nature.

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS

### AP-01: Scare Tactics [Layer 2]
Using fear/crime statistics to sell security products. Like an insurance salesman screaming "You may die!" in a basement. Instead: present product professionally, let concerned consumers come to you.

### AP-02: Cliches [Layer 3]
"It's the product the world has been waiting for" or "It's too good to be true." Signal lazy thinking and fill space without meaning. If it sounds like typical agency copy from 20 years ago, cut it.

### AP-03: Saying Too Much [Layer 3]
Making copy too obvious or too complete. Kills mental engagement. The reader's mind must work to reach conclusions -- if you state everything, the experience is less stimulating and persuasive.

### AP-04: Violating Harmony [Layer 2]
Making a statement the reader will disagree with. Once the reader says "No" or "I don't believe that," you've lost them. Every statement must be truthful and agreeable.

### AP-05: Ignoring Objections [Layer 2]
Failing to raise and resolve obvious product flaws. The reader sees through it. Worse than addressing the flaw directly. "If you sense that there might be an objection and you ignore it, it's like ignoring that consumer."

### AP-06: Too Many Choices [Layer 2]
Offering 9 models when 1 would sell 3x more. Swiss Army watch test proved this definitively. Confusion = no purchase.

### AP-07: Copying Format Too Closely [Layer 3]
Patterning is acceptable for learning. Copying layout too closely violates the rights of the original writer and creates confusion about who is selling.

### AP-08: Wrong Satisfaction Conviction [Layer 3]
Raising an objection and satisfying it with the wrong resolution. The conviction must make sense for the specific offer.

### AP-09: Dishonesty [Layer 1]
"Try to lie in your copy and you are only deceiving yourself. Your copy will say what you think you wanted it to say, but it will also say what you thought you covered up."

### AP-10: Missing Physical Facts [Layer 3]
Not listing weight, dimensions, or other physical attributes. Gives customer an excuse not to order. "If you don't give all the facts, it gives your customer the excuse not to order."

### AP-11: Making Specific Claims for Hope Products [Layer 3]
If a product works on hope (vitamins, wrinkle creams, golf balls), do NOT make specific measurable promises. Let testimonials imply results. The scientist who promised growths would disappear "in a few months" destroyed credibility when they didn't.
