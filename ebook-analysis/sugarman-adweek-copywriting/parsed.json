He cracked me up with the sheer exuberance of his copy approach.\n\n He offered readers $10 for every spelling error they found in his copy. (“Please don’t correct my grammar.”)\n\n He offered “loaner” watches to customers as part of a service guarantee.\n\n He offered a $6 million home for sale in the airline magazines, accepting American Express, Visa, MasterCard or any negotiable hard currency.\n\n He sold a $240,000 airplane in a single mail order ad.",

There were others. Louis Victor Eytinge, a convicted murderer who learned how to write in prison. Or Gene Schwartz, the art collector, who made his living writing stuff like “She Fled the Table When the Doctor Said Cut Her Open.”\n\n But Joe surpassed those guys in a few very important ways—the sheer volume of his writing, the trends that he set and my favorite, the personal catalog, one in which the copy and the product reflect the quirks of the owner.

Greats like David Margoles, who sold 4 million garlic crushers in the 1950s.\n\n Then there was Max Sackheim, co-founder of the Book-of-the-Month Club and another great pitchman who lived by his wits. As Lester Wunderman in 1996 reflected about Sackheim, “When he talked to clients, he promised a breakthrough—not as we have now, minuscule improvement.”\n\n Then there was John Caples, who entered American folklore by writing “They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano.” The late Larry Chait asked Caples why he stressed the social benefits instead of just selling the virtues of the course.",

You can’t sell that. But you can sell the idea of social success and overcoming whatever deficiencies you have in order to become popular.”\n\n Though he may never have met them, Sugarman knows on a gut level what these guys knew. And that’s important, because he’s one of the last of a breed.\n\n Now for the good news. He’s passed the tradition down in this handbook, the best book ever done on the subject of mail order writing.\n\n Besides the advice on selling, it stresses basic truths about writing, in language anyone can understand. I’ve even given the manuscript to my new reporters to read.\n\n I’m sad to report that Sugarman doesn’t write as much copy as he used to—no more catalogs and very few space ads.

This process would cause me to search my brain, my data bank, and all my past experiences for some way to relate the three words while keeping in mind that I had to sell the airplane.\n\nThe Adweek Copywriting Handbook \n \n \n \n \n \n The Dictionary as a Tool",

I appreciate the offer, but I don’t really believe in insurance,” was my standard reply.\n\n But Howard was a good salesman. Every once in a while Howard would clip out an article on calculators from a local paper or an article from some magazine on some new gadget and send it to me with his card.

He was only in his 40s. I was 36 at the time.\n\n The next day I called Howard on the phone. “Howard, remember our many discussions on insurance and protecting your family and stuff?

I knew that to scare people into buying a burglar alarm was like Howard coming into my basement and saying, “Joe, when you die, are you going to leave your wife and kids in financial disaster?” That would never sell me insurance.

Just remember this axiom.\n\n This means if somebody asks you, “With the Sugarman approach to copywriting, what is the purpose of the subheadline in the ad?” don’t answer, “A subheadline is designed to give you more information and to further explain the attention-getting headline.”\n\n Neither of the above reasons is as important as the fact that the subheadline is designed to get the reader to read the copy.",

Whether it be a private room in a gallery or a car dealer’s showroom, you configure the physical environment to be your selling environment.\n\n Next, you have to get the attention of the prospect. That certainly makes sense and is related to the headline of a print ad.\n\n Once you have the prospect’s attention, the next step is to introduce yourself and say something that will keep the attention of the prospect. This is similar to the subheadline and the photos and captions. Then comes the sales pitch or the copy in a print ad.",

First, you’ve got to get the prospective reader to start saying yes. Second, you’ve got to make statements that are both honest and believable. Let’s cite an example. A car salesman says, “Nice day, Mr. Jones.” Mr. Jones then answers, “Yes.” (It is a nice day, the statement is truthful and the customer answers in the affirmative.) “I see, Mr. Jones, that you keep your car very clean.” “Yes, I do.” (At this point, the salesman has Mr. Jones saying yes and nodding his head.)\n\n \n Get the customer to nod in the affirmative and agree with you. \n\n \n\n “I see, Mr. Jones, that since you now own a Buick and we sell Buicks, you probably could use a new one?” “Yes.” (The salesman asks a rather obvious question and Mr. Jones, nodding, replies in the affirmative.)",

Make sure that the prospect does not disagree with something you’re saying. If for example the salesman said, “Could you use a new Buick?” and the customer said “No,” the sale would have taken a bad turn right there and the harmony would have been lost.

The first ad, by John Sauer, was written right after our major fuel crunch in 1973, when there were lines of cars at gas pumps that had little or no fuel to pump. The ad is shown on the next page with my ad above it. John chose the concept of insurance as the best approach in his ad. I felt that insurance put people to sleep.

The restraint was sufficient to hold the baby elephant in place even if it wanted to break away. And break away is indeed what the baby elephant tried to do.\n\n So every day while the baby was chained up, it would pull at the chain and pull and pull until finally a cut appeared on its leg exposing the sore sensitive layers of deep skin tissue. It hurt to pull like that and soon the baby elephant, realizing the effort was both futile and painful, stopped trying to escape.\n\nThe Adweek Copywriting Handbook \n \n \n \n \n \n Elephants Never Forget\n\n As the baby elephant grew older, it never forgot that bad experience with the chain and the peg.

I use sentences such as:\n\n But there’s more.\n\n So read on.\n\n But I didn’t stop there.\n\n Let me explain.\n\n Now here comes the good part.\n\n These seeds of curiosity cause you to subconsciously continue reading even though you might be at a point in the copy where the copy slows down. This concept is used a lot on TV before the show host goes to a commercial. She may say, “When we come back, we’ll see something that you’ve never seen on TV before.

And using these seeds of curiosity enhances most copy. But like every good thing, don’t overdo it. Later in this book I will be showing examples of seeds of curiosity at work in many of my ads. Use them; they are very effective. But there’s another example.\n\n Seeds of curiosity can be used at the beginning of an ad where you mention some benefit or payoff that you are going to reveal somewhere in your copy. In short, the reader has to read the entire ad to find it. A good example of this technique was in our Consumers Hero ad mentioned in Chapter 8 and reproduced in Chapter 34.

If you’re very creative, it, too, is picked up. And it is the combination of all of these impressions that creates the buying environment that we referred to in Chapter 6.\n\n If you study the copy of others, you can sense what they are like from their copy.

If the sales presentation takes an hour, then it should be an hour long—not more and not 15 minutes. And so it is with copy.

If they use a long headline, make your headline long. If they use a lot of captions, then you create a number of captions. Capture the feel of the ad, but be careful. Do not copy the person’s layout too closely so that people reading the ad might think at first glance it was from the company you were copying.

Once again, it is a mental process that almost parallels that of the copywriting act itself. It requires lots of practice, although you will find it easier to do than writing the copy itself. In fact, it is a lot more fun. Look at the act of writing the first draft as giving birth. It may be a painful, long process or it can go quite quickly with little pain. Then compare the editing process to raising the child—the caring and nurturing required to ensure a healthy, happy child.\n\n You wouldn’t want your child to go out into the world in funny clothes, unable to communicate or relate with others, would you?

But it brought out many of the principles of good editing. The following are five of the principles they learned:\n\nThe Adweek Copywriting Handbook \n \n \n \n \n \n Some Principles of Editing\n\n \n 1. Look for any “that” words. For example, in my first draft I used the words, “And, if you’ve tried it, you know that. . . .” The words up to and including “that” can very often be eliminated. In this example, I could eliminate eight words.",

Make sure that you vary the length of sentences so they don’t sound monotonous. I discuss rhythm later in this book, in Chapter 18.\n\n 3. Consider combining sentences. Note that in the edited version, I combined the two sentences that read, “A bathroom scale is like a report card. It’s a feedback mechanism that tells you how well you’ve done.” I condensed it into “Your bathroom scale is like a report card—a feedback mechanism that tells you how well you’ve done.” I saved only one word by doing this, but it made sense to combine the sentences and eliminating even one word is a good move.\n\n 4. Eliminate unnecessary words. Look at the word “the” in the phrase “and seeing the positive results.” The word “the” can easily be eliminated without changing the meaning so that the final sentence will read, “and seeing positive results.”",

Note that in the first draft, the flow of the copy pointed out that the scale was a report card and the second thought was that part of the pleasure of a weight loss program was stepping on a scale and seeing the positive results. By reversing these two thoughts, I made the ad more emotional by focusing on the pleasure of using a scale when losing weight and then I explained why. This sounds a lot better and more logical from a flow standpoint than the first draft.\n\nThe Adweek Copywriting Handbook \n \n \n \n \n \n Take as Long as You Need\n\n Sometimes editing is like raising and nurturing your child and you need to take a lot of time.

And as a copywriter you don’t have much space to work with. So I use commas where the rules of grammar are clear that they are needed for clarification. I don’t use commas in places where I am not violating any grammatical rules or where they are considered optional. For example, when three items are grouped together, such as “apples, oranges and tomatoes,” I don’t use a serial comma after “oranges.”\n\n I would have both my sister Judy, who is a high school teacher, and Mary Stanke, my associate at JS&A, proof all my copy.

Fancy type might look elegant to the type designer, but if it can’t be read it has no value. It’s like talking to a foreigner and finding the words difficult to understand.

Anticipate Objections: This is a very important element to consider when writing copy. If you feel that your prospect might raise some objection when you are describing a product, then raise the objection yourself. Remember, you’re not in front of the consumer and you have to sense what the next question might be. If you sense that there might be an objection and you ignore it, it’s like ignoring that consumer. You won’t get away with it. The consumer is too sharp and will not buy.\n\n A good example of anticipating objections is in that ad we saw earlier in Chapter 16 for that expensive electronic pinball game from Bally Manufacturing.

So I raised the objection at the very beginning of the ad, calling it the worst-looking product I’d ever seen.

With the pinball game, we talked about the modular circuit boards that you simply snap out and exchange if service is required. More on this later in copy element 14, “Service.” In 2006 Gillette introduced its new five-bladed vibrating Fusion razor, which uses a small AAA battery located in the handle of the razor.

Women are generally into color, fashion, family, home and relationships. Men are more likely into sports, military combat, machines, earning money and supporting their family.

Vary your sentences; vary their length to give your copy a rhythm.\n\n Another rhythm technique is the use of what is called a “triad.” Very often when I list examples or attributes of something, I use just three of them. For example, take the sentence, “I went shopping for a hammer, a screwdriver and a pair of pliers.” In copy you list three items in a series with the last item preceded by the word and , and you create a nice rhythm within that sentence.

Service: If you are selling an expensive product or one that is not easily returned for service, you must address the question of service and convey the ease of that service to the consumer. Often the mention of a brand name manufacturer is all that is needed to establish ease of service. But if there is a remote possibility that the consumer would still ask about service, then you must address this issue in your ad.\n\n In selling our Bally pinball game by mail, we knew that a buyer might have concerns about the matter of service. What if the pinball game broke and required repair? It was large and expensive and the inconvenience of a broken game would be in the back of our customers’ minds. We addressed that in the ad.

Joe’s books on salesmanship are worth reading for their many insights, but the one factor that made Joe such an effective salesman (aside from the fact that he was a very personable guy) was the way he handled service. His customers’ service problems became his. And each time he sold a car, Joe became that buyer’s personal service representative. And Joe performed.

Physical Facts: In copy you must mention all the physical facts about a product or you risk reducing your response. I’m talking about weight, dimensions, size, limits, speed, and the like. Sometimes you might think that a certain dimension isn’t really important or the weight may not be necessary. But it’s not true. Give readers any excuse not to buy and they won’t buy.\n\n I remember running ads for products and then personally taking the orders on our toll-free lines. I did this because it was on the phone lines that I got many of my insights into the buying process.

Of course, they didn’t order, either.\n\n I remember an ad for a scale pictured on the floor. I didn’t give the actual weight of the scale itself. “Who would care?” I thought. But my prospects did care and frequently asked. We eventually included the weight of the scale in the ad. I remember showing an object that was being held in my hand.

Trial Period: With mail order items, you must offer a trial period for any product that the consumer cannot touch or feel at the time of purchase. The only time you can make an exception to this rule is when the value is so strong and the product so familiar that the consumer is willing to take the risk. If I were selling a box of 24 rolls of toilet paper at a bargain price delivered to your home and it was a brand that you already used, then you wouldn’t need a trial period.\n\n Make sure your trial period is at least one month, or even better, two months.

And no solid-state watch can compare to Sensor’s quality, accuracy, ruggedness and exceptional value.\n\n If you are selling an expensive item or something that is a good value when compared to another product, you should always consider a price comparison as a means of establishing the value of your product. If your product is the most expensive product being offered, then you want to suggest that it has more or better features. If your product is less expensive, then you want to focus on better value and use a price comparison.",

Testimonials: A testimonial is a good way to add credibility if it is from a very credible person or organization. This approach can be used not only in the copy but in the headline or photo. See if your ad copy could use a celebrity for a testimonial, but make sure the testimonial makes sense for the product.\n\n When I was selling a space-age Midex security system, it made sense to ask Wally Schirra, the famous astronaut, to endorse my product. He did, and the product sold very well. If I were selling basketball shoes, Michael Jordan would be a natural.",

The use of a celebrity who doesn’t make sense for your product or doesn’t add credibility could backfire, have the wrong effect and kill sales if the offer is not believable.\n\n You can also use what I call a “reverse testimonial.” That is where you don’t use a spokesperson but you refer to your competitor’s. For example, when I was selling the Olympus micro recorder, I stated the following:\n\n Headline: Endorsement Battle\n\n Subheadline: A famous golf star endorses the Lanier. Our unit is endorsed by our president. You’ll save $100 as a result.\n\n Copy: Judge for yourself. That new Olympus micro recorder shown above sells for $150.

Avoid Saying Too Much: This is probably the biggest mistake my students make. They say too much. There are really two issues here. The first issue is one of editing. It is normal to say as much as you can about a subject and then refine the copy to a point where it flows smoothly. This usually means editing and reducing the copy length until it has rhythm and it flows. This could take time and involves a few steps.\n\n First, say to yourself as you go through the editing process, “Is there a simpler way of saying this?” Very often you can cut your copy down 50 to even 80 percent and still say the same thing. It’s the difference between a salesperson who talks too much and one who is to the point and succinct. Wouldn’t you rather be sold by the one who is to the point?",

Chapter 17 on editing also has ideas that will help you reduce your copy.\n\n 22. Ease of Ordering: Make it easy to order. Use a toll-free number, a coupon, a tear-off reply card or any vehicle that is easy to understand and use. My recommendation: Use a coupon with dotted lines. In tests, it usually generates more response because the dotted lines clearly convey at a glance that you can order the product from the ad.",

It’s happened to me. And it is one of the problems with a lot of inexperienced salespeople. You’ve got to ask for the order, and if you’re doing it right, it should be at the very end of the ad where you’ve finished selling your prospect, you’ve summarized the offer and your prospect is ready to buy.",

See how easy it is to store under your bed. . . .” In short, you are making them feel that they have already bought the product.\n\n Advertising copy that involves the reader can be quite effective—especially if the involvement device is part of the advertising.

Honesty\n\n If I had to pick the single most important point of the 64 points, I would pick honesty. Your advertising must be honest. This doesn’t mean that if you are dishonest in your message you won’t achieve a successful result. Give the consumer a price that’s too hard to believe or a product that doesn’t live up to its claims and you might be able to get away with it once, maybe even twice, but not for the long haul.\n\n But this section on honesty is not about whether you can get away with being dishonest and for how long.

Your job is establishing credibility for your price.

You buy a Mercedes automobile emotionally but you then justify its purchase logically with its technology, safety and resale value. So justifying its value is something that the consumer wants to do before making an emotional purchase.\n\n And with such intense competition in the world, there is a question in the mind of the consumer: “Am I buying the product at the best price?” Once again, you must resolve that question or you are not communicating effectively with your prospect.",

If you don’t resolve it, then you won’t answer all the prospect’s questions and this will give the prospect the excuse to “think about it” and, of course, never buy.\n\n Somewhere in your ad, you should resolve any objection by providing some justification to the purchaser. Sometimes it’s just saying, “You deserve it.” And other times you might have to justify it in terms of savings (the price is a one-time-only value), health reasons (protects your eyes), recognition (the men in your life will love the way you look in it) or dozens of other reasons based on the wants and needs of your prospect.",

Providing the consumer with more than what is normally received for the price is a way of appealing to the consumer’s greed.\n\n In one of my earlier ads in the Wall Street Journal, I offered a calculator for $49.95 and the manufacturer got really upset with me. “That product should have sold for $69.95 and now I have dealers all over the country calling me and complaining,” screamed the manufacturer.",

But it should be recognized as an effective element that plays on everybody’s weakness.\n\n When you lower the price of a product, you usually end up with more unit sales. Keep lowering the price, and you’ll continue to generate more unit sales than before if the price drop is big enough.

In an ad I wrote for the company called Consumers Hero, I was offering subscriptions to a discount bulletin showing refurbished products at very low prices. But rather than just mail the bulletin to prospects, I formed a club and offered a subscription to the bulletin. I tested various elements in the 700-word ad. I changed the headline and tested it and improved response by 20 percent. I changed the price and saw little change in total response. The lower the price, however, the more orders I received. But when I changed just the satisfaction conviction, the response rate doubled.\n\n In one ad, I said, “If you don’t buy anything during your two-year subscription, I’ll refund the unused portion of your subscription.”",

Fine. Send us just your membership card and we’ll fully refund your five dollars plus send you interest on your money.”\n\n In the first ad, you see a basic, simple trial-period type offer. In the second version, however, you see an offer that goes well beyond the trial period and can be classified as a satisfaction conviction.\n\n In the test, the response doubled even though the satisfaction conviction was at the very end of the ad. This meant that people read the entire ad and then, at the very end when that important buying decision had to be made, the satisfaction conviction removed any remaining resistance to buying into the concept.",

Basically, it is the technique of relating what the consumer already knows and understands with what you are selling to make the new product easy to understand and relate to.\n\n One of the easiest ways to explain this trigger is to describe how it works in a fad—a craze that captures the public’s consciousness and quickly creates strong demand, awareness or behavioral changes. The demand can be for a product such as for the Beanie Babies in the 1990s or the citizens band (CB) radios back in the 1970s.

Then I’ll take it deeper to give you a sense of how linking can be used to effectively sell any product or service.\n\n For example, I used the awareness of a presidential act as a way of selling products. When it was discovered in 1973 that Nixon was using phone tap equipment to record all his phone conversations, there was enormous publicity about it.

I offered a walkie-talkie right at the height of the citizens band (CB) radio boom in the United States. By calling my walkie-talkie a Pocket CB because it broadcast on one of the CB frequencies, I was able to capture a major chunk of the CB market.\n\n The minute there is a lot of publicity about something and it has the potential to turn into a fad, you could have a great opportunity to link it onto something that you’re doing either to get publicity or to promote a product.",

The headline read: “The Nose.” I talked about the smoke detector not as a smoke detector (many such devices were already being sold) but as a nose that sat on your ceiling and sniffed the air. When it smelled smoke, it set off an alarm. I took the very human and simple concept of a nose—a part of the body whose function is well understood—and then linked it to an electronic device.\n\n In the ad I also used linking to express quality. For example, I talked about the integrated circuits using gold for the contact points. My prospect was then able to link the expense and quality of gold to this product to arrive at a quality link and justify its higher price. In actuality, every integrated circuit used gold for its contact points, so this wasn’t revolutionary, but nobody had taken the time to explain it to the consumer.",

I called it “The Mafia Auto Gadget.” Can you see the linkage with this product? No? Well, I explained it in the ad. The Mafia often used explosives activated by a car’s ignition to eliminate competition. Because this device started the car for you at a distance, it eliminated the fear and concern for any Mafia member. Of course, the market was also broadened to include those people who simply liked the convenience of prestarting their cars on hot or cold days and having the cars reach a pleasant temperature before they got in.

An additional sale occurs over 50 percent of the time, depending on my added offer.\n\n Once you’ve committed to the original purchase, you are poised for a course of action consistent with what you have already undertaken.

People are buying these products because they want to protect themselves from the virus, which today is a real and present danger.

Human Relationships\n\n It is always important to relate the product or service you are offering in human terms. How the product will fit, how it will feel, how it will look—these are just some of the ways you can relate. That may seem pretty obvious.\n\n But there are other ways that copy or graphics can bring a human element to an advertisement. And let’s look at why this is important.\n\n Buying is an emotional human experience when we exchange our hard-earned money for a product or service. And because we worked hard for that money, the act of buying represents more than just handing over our money. Buying something becomes an emotional event.",

I’m talking about the ones that look like a U-shaped piece of metal. Clang one of the metal tines and you hear a vibration. Take two tuning forks and if they are of the same frequency and you hit just one, the other one will start vibrating even though it did not come into physical contact with the first one.\n\n Taking this experiment one step further, if you take several tuning forks and put them together and hit them all, they will create a harmonic frequency all their own. And if you just happen to know what that combined frequency is and have a tuning fork that matches that frequency, then, it too, will start to vibrate in resonance with all the other tuning forks.",

Take a sample of your copy—start with 100 to 125 words from the very beginning of the ad.\n\n 2. Count the words in each sentence.

The story starts out with us hating the product, and then as the story unfolds, the product takes a quantum leap in our approval to become the best product on the planet. How I get there is an interesting process.\n\n First I realized that the number one drawback in purchasing a thermostat is the installation. It’s not one of those things that consumers relate to. It could be dangerous handling all those wires and there’s a lot of extra expense in having an installer put one in. So one of the first good features we finally like in our story is the ease of installation.

Blue rays have one of the shortest wavelengths in the visible spectrum (red is the longest). As a result, the color blue will focus slightly in front of the retina, which is the “focusing screen” in our eye. By blocking the blue from the sunlight through a special filtration process and only letting those rays through that indeed focus clearly on the retina, objects appear to be sharper and clearer.\n\n The second reason is even more impressive. It is harmful to have ultraviolet rays fall on our eyes.

If you’re an executive who sits at a desk for long hours, your back muscles soon grow weak and cannot support your spine and your skeletal frame as it was designed to do.\n\n What I like about the back machine is how easy it works to strengthen the back. As little as five minutes a day and three days a week is all the exercise you need to start the program. And since the exercise time is so short and not very strenuous, you can exercise anytime of the day or night.",

I can’t guarantee that your lower back problems will be gone forever, but the Nautilus Lower Back machine can really make a difference. And even with its low price, the Nautilus comes with a 30-day exercise trial period. If the unit doesn’t make a big difference in your exercise program, return the unit to JS&A for a full refund of your purchase price. But act quickly.

A catalog description should contain all the information you need for your prospect to make a buying decision. Leave out one small fact, and you run the risk of reducing your response. The missing fact gives the buyer an excuse to delay his or her decision. And it raises a question as to whether the product will fit his or her needs.

The single style offer worked best in the mail order ad, whereas the other watch styles worked best in our catalog.\n\n Finally, what works exceptionally well for product catalogs is the personal sales message—something that I have used for years with great success. Let each product description sound like a personal conversation with the prospect.\n\n Say “I” or “me” or “my,” and talk as if you were a friendly person chatting with your prospect.

And to enhance that trust there is nothing like having your prospects know clearly whom they are dealing with. Your prospects will pick up the vibrations of what you write, especially if you are making your communications sound very personal.\n\n Direct mail copy is among the most personal types of copy you can write.

A radio spot is typically from 10 seconds to 60 seconds in duration, and there is also the long-form radio commercial referred to as “brokered time.” This is where the advertiser buys the time slot (usually a half hour to an hour) and uses it just like a talk show to promote his or her own business.

You listen to the message in a linear fashion one statement after the next,” says O’Day.\n\n O’Day points out that radio is also a very visual medium in the sense that the listener has to imagine what is being described. For example, if a child is described as beautiful, the listener pictures a child he or she considers to be beautiful. If this was done on TV and a child was shown, there might be a credibility gap.

Keeping the offer simple and uncomplicated is critical. Anything that complicates the commercial will lose sales. The only exception to this rule is near the end of the spot when you start adding on additional items to increase the value. For example, “If you call within the next 20 minutes, I’ll also include an extra mixer free of charge. That’s two mixers for $19.95.” Don’t give the prospect a choice to make. There should be only one choice—“Buy this product now and get all of this.” Don’t offer different colors or sizes. It’s one offer and no choices.

Some like to buy on the phone, others through the mail and still others on the Internet. You want to appeal to all of them.

The free bonus gift was a cloth TV remote holder that you would drape over the side of your chair. Even though logically the cloth remote holder made sense because the table would be used primarily for TV, this was a bad idea. First, your chair may not have a side to it. Secondly, many viewers may not care for the free gift anyway and would reject the main offer because in their minds they would be paying more for something they didn’t want.\n\n The key in all these offers is to test the free gift versus no gift and maybe against another gift.

Then the BluBlocker sunglasses made their first showing in 1986, and shortly thereafter came the exercise, self-help and get-rich-quick shows. Infomercials became extremely popular in a very short period of time. Overnight companies launched what soon became household names.

And you will make plenty of sales in the process.\n\nThe Adweek Copywriting Handbook \n \n \n \n \n \n The Internet Infomercial",

After all, you’ve got the audio and video capabilities right on your computer—the same elements you see on commercial or cable TV.\n\n And if somebody is interested in your product or service, they’ll appreciate seeing and hearing as much information about it as possible.\n\n Typically, the length of an infomercial on TV is 28½ minutes. But when you are using the Web, your infomercial can be any length you want. You can run one on TV and run it on the Web in its full length or you can edit it to 15 minutes and run it in a shorter format. There are also a few rules to keep in mind as you prepare an infomercial for the Web.\n\n The first rule is regarding price: The more expensive the product, in general, the longer the infomercial.",

Since you are on the Web, you can make it very easy to place an order. Simply put an “Order Now” button on your screen when you would normally put the call to action. (It can be in the first five minutes or later in the show.) Your prospect will press the Order Now button and place the order.\n\n The third rule to remember has to do with attention span. Your typical Internet viewer has a much shorter attention span than your TV viewer and is more likely to leave your site than a TV viewer is to switch channels. TV viewers are accustomed to half-hour segments, so once they are viewing a show they may be less inclined to change channels. If they did, they would end up in the middle of some other program. Not so on the Internet. They can go anywhere on their computers—from checking e-mail to finding something else that might interest them.",

You can do the upsell with audio and video once they’ve made the buying decision and have placed the order. You should also list the toll-free number. Many will not feel comfortable placing their order on the Web and will want to talk to a real human.\n\n Your infomercial need not be expensive. You can shoot your program with a good quality consumer video camera. And it could be a simple format like you being interviewed by somebody.\n\n You will start seeing more and more infomercials on the Internet in the very near future.

No waiting. Instant gratification is what a retail store offers. But when you buy through the Internet and the product is shipped to you, there is a lag time. To beat the retailers at their own game, Internet stores have learned to ship almost on the same day if possible to allow that item to arrive quickly. Shipping promptly greatly reduces the advantage retail has over mail order.\n\n Let’s get back to that company that sold the leather jacket.

Or we’ll give it to you. We just want to do it. Pay our salary, we’ll come work for you.’ And they said, ‘No.’ So then we went to Hewlett-Packard, and they said, ‘Hey, we don’t need you. You haven’t got through college yet.’” This was related by Steven Jobs, Apple Computer cofounder, on his attempts in the mid-1970s to get Atari and Hewlett-Packard interested in his and Steve Wozniak’s personal computer.\n\n 6. “A cookie store is a bad idea. Besides, the market research reports say America likes crispy cookies, not soft and chewy cookies like you make.” This was a response in the mid-1970s to Debbi Fields’ idea of starting Mrs. Fields Cookies. \n\n 7. “640K ought to be enough for anybody.” Bill Gates, Microsoft founder, 1981.",

You had to turn to the back of the book before you read the next line of copy in Chapter 10. Well, you just fell for the seeds of curiosity theory big time:\n\n Your message must always be so compelling that you motivate the reader to do things normally not done.\n\n I realize that you might think this is a dirty trick and the story never took place. You’re wrong on both counts. This is exactly what happened and this is no dirty trick. But to get people to reach into their pockets and exchange their hard-earned dollars for your product is not a natural act. It’s one of the most difficult things a copywriter must do to sell a product. It requires tremendous motivation—motivation that needs to be generated by a compelling message, a message so compelling that people will b",

(page 38)\n\n Axiom 5 : Get the reader to say yes and harmonize with your accurate and truthful statements while reading your copy.
