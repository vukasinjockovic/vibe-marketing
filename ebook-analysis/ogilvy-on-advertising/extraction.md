## 1. DECISION RULES

### DR-01: Do Your Homework First [Layer 0 - Foundation]
**IF** you are assigned a product to advertise **THEN** spend extensive time studying the product before writing a word.
> "The more you know about it, the more likely you are to come up with a big idea for selling it."
> "When I got the Rolls-Royce account, I spent three weeks reading about the car."
> "If you are too lazy to do this kind of homework, you may occasionally luck into a successful campaign, but you will run the risk of skidding about on what my brother Francis called 'the slippery surface of irrelevant brilliance.'"

### DR-02: Headlines Must Promise a Benefit [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** writing a headline **THEN** promise the reader a benefit -- a whiter wash, more miles per gallon, freedom from pimples, fewer cavities.
> "The headlines which work best are those which promise the reader a benefit."
> "Advertising which promises no benefit to the consumer does not sell, yet the majority of campaigns contain no promise whatever. (That is the most important sentence in this book. Read it again.)"
> "Advertisements with headlines that promise a benefit are read by an average of four times more people than advertisements that don't."

### DR-03: Include News in Headlines [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** you have news to tell (new product, improvement, new use) **THEN** put it in the headline, not buried in body copy.
> "Headlines which contain news are sure-fire."
> "On the average, ads with news are recalled by 22 per cent more people than ads without news."
> "Don't scorn tried-and-true words like amazing, introducing, now, suddenly."

### DR-04: Include Brand Name in Headline [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** writing a headline **THEN** include the brand name.
> "I advise you to include the brand name in your headline. If you don't, 80 per cent of readers (who don't read your body copy) will never know what product you are advertising."

### DR-05: Flag Your Target Audience [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** your product is bought by a small group **THEN** put a flagging word in your headline (e.g., asthma, bedwetters, women over thirty-five).
> "If you are advertising a kind of product which is only bought by a small group of people, put a word in your headline which will flag them down."

### DR-06: Use Quotes in Headlines [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** possible **THEN** put your headline in quotation marks.
> "When you put your headline in quotes, you increase recall by an average of 28 per cent."

### DR-07: Specifics Beat Generalities [Layer 2 - Headline/Copy]
**IF** you can state a specific fact **THEN** always prefer it over a vague generality.
> "Specifics work better than generalities. When research reported that the average shopper thought Sears Roebuck made a profit of 37 per cent on sales, I headlined an advertisement Sears makes a profit of 5 per cent."

### DR-08: Localize for Local Media [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** advertising in local newspapers **THEN** include the name of each city in your headline.
> "When you advertise in local newspapers, you get better results if you include the name of each city in your headline. People are most interested in what is happening where they live."

### DR-09: Long Headlines Can Work [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** you need a long headline to convey the promise **THEN** write one without fear.
> "On the average, long headlines sell more merchandise than short ones."
> "A study of retail advertisements found that headlines of ten words sell more merchandise than short headlines."

### DR-10: Avoid Blind Headlines [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** your headline does not say what the product is or what it will do **THEN** it is "blind" and will underperform.
> "Some headlines are 'blind.' They don't say what the product is, or what it will do for you. They are about 20 per cent below average in recall."

### DR-11: Never Run Without a Headline [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** tempted to run an ad without a headline **THEN** stop -- this is the worst possible mistake.
> "Since headlines, more than anything else, decide the success or failure of an advertisement, the silliest thing of all is to run an ad without any headline at all."

### DR-12: Avoid Tricky Headlines [Layer 2 - Headline]
**IF** tempted to use puns, double meanings, or obscurities **THEN** resist -- telegraph your message clearly.
> "Some copywriters write tricky headlines -- double meanings, puns and other obscurities. This is counter-productive. In the average newspaper your headline has to compete with 350 others."

### DR-13: Photograph Choice Determines Success [Layer 3 - Visual]
**IF** choosing an illustration **THEN** prioritize "story appeal" -- images that arouse curiosity and make the reader ask "What goes on here?"
> "The kind of photographs which work hardest are those which arouse the reader's curiosity."
> "Harold Rudolph called this magic element 'Story Appeal,' and demonstrated that the more of it you inject into your photographs, the more people look at your advertisements."

### DR-14: Use Photographs Over Drawings [Layer 3 - Visual]
**IF** choosing between photograph and drawing **THEN** default to photographs.
> "Photographs attracted more readers, were more believable, and better remembered."
> "Direct-response advertisers find that photographs pull more coupons than drawings."

### DR-15: Show Before-and-After [Layer 3 - Visual]
**IF** you can show a before-and-after result **THEN** always do it.
> "In a study of 70 campaigns whose sales results were known, Gallup did not find a single before-and-after campaign that did not increase sales."

### DR-16: Use Four-Color Ads [Layer 3 - Visual]
**IF** budget allows **THEN** use four-color.
> "Advertisements in four colors cost 50 per cent more than black-and-white, but, on the average, they are 100 per cent more memorable. A good bargain."

### DR-17: Keep Illustrations Simple [Layer 3 - Visual]
**IF** choosing subjects for illustrations **THEN** focus on one person, avoid crowd scenes.
> "Keep your illustrations as simple as possible, with the focus of interest on one person. Crowd scenes don't pull."
> "Don't show human faces enlarged bigger than life size. They seem to repel readers."

### DR-18: Always Caption Your Illustrations [Layer 3 - Layout]
**IF** using any illustration **THEN** put a caption under it with brand name and promise.
> "More people read the captions under illustrations than read the body copy, so never use an illustration without putting a caption under it."

### DR-19: Write Copy as Conversation [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** writing body copy **THEN** write as one human being to another, second person singular.
> "Do not address your readers as though they were gathered together in a stadium. When people read your copy, they are alone. Pretend you are writing each of them a letter."
> "Queen Victoria complained that Gladstone talked to her as if he were addressing a public meeting. She preferred Disraeli, who talked to her like a human being."

### DR-20: Never Bore the Reader [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** writing copy **THEN** make it interesting above all else.
> "You cannot bore people into buying your product. You can only interest them in buying it."

### DR-21: Use Simple Words [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** tempted to use a fancy word **THEN** use a simpler one.
> "It pays to write short sentences and short paragraphs, and to avoid difficult words."
> "I once wrote that Dove made soap 'obsolete,' only to discover that the majority of housewives did not know what the word meant."

### DR-22: Write in Story Form [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** possible **THEN** cast your copy as a story.
> "Write your copy in the form of a story."
> "'They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano -- But When I Started to Play...' "

### DR-23: Use Testimonials [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** you can get testimonials **THEN** include them for credibility.
> "If you include a testimonial in your copy, you make it more credible. Readers find the endorsements of fellow consumers more persuasive than the puffery of anonymous copywriters."
> Exception: "Testimonials from celebrities get high recall scores, but I have stopped using them because readers remember the celebrity and forget the product."
> Better: "Testimonials from experts can be persuasive -- like having an ex-burglar testify that he had never been able to crack a Chubb safe."

### DR-24: Include the Price [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** possible **THEN** include the price of the product.
> "Always try to include the price of your products."
> "When the price of the product is left out, people have a way of turning the page."

### DR-25: Long Copy Outsells Short Copy [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** writing for direct response or high-consideration products **THEN** use long copy.
> "All my experience says that for a great many products, long copy sells more than short."
> "Direct-response advertisers know that short copy doesn't sell. In split-run tests, long copy invariably outsells short copy."
> "'The more facts you tell, the more you sell.'"
> "I believe, without any research to support me, that advertisements with long copy convey the impression that you have something important to say, whether people read the copy or not."

### DR-26: Grabber First Paragraph [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** writing long copy **THEN** your first paragraph must be a grabber.
> "If you want your long copy to be read, you had better write it well. In particular, your first paragraph should be a grabber."
> "Limit your opening paragraph to a maximum of 11 words."

### DR-27: Avoid Analogies [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** tempted to use an analogy **THEN** reconsider -- they are widely misunderstood.
> "Gallup has found that they are widely misunderstood. If you are writing copy for a face cream and say, 'Just as plants require moisture, so too does your skin,' readers don't complete the equation."

### DR-28: Avoid Superlatives [Layer 2 - Body Copy]
**IF** tempted to write "Our product is the best in the world" **THEN** don't.
> "Stay away from superlatives like 'Our product is the best in the world.' Gallup calls this Brag and Boast. It convinces nobody."

### DR-29: Layout Order: Illustration-Headline-Copy [Layer 3 - Layout]
**IF** laying out a print ad **THEN** put illustration at top, headline below illustration, copy below headline.
> "Readers look first at the illustration, then at the headline, then at the copy. So put these elements in that order."
> "Headlines below the illustration are read by 10 per cent more people than headlines above the illustration."

### DR-30: Use Editorial Layout Style [Layer 3 - Layout]
**IF** designing an ad **THEN** make it look like editorial content, not an advertisement.
> "If you make them look like editorial pages, you will attract more readers. Roughly six times as many people read the average article as the average advertisement."
> Use: "Serif type. Three columns of type, 35 to 45 characters wide. Every photograph has a caption. Drop-initials. Black type on white."

### DR-31: Never Use Reverse Type [Layer 3 - Typography]
**IF** tempted to set type in reverse (white on black) **THEN** don't.
> "It is almost impossible to read."
> When a charity "tested black type on a white background, they raised twice as much money."

### DR-32: Never Set Headlines in All Capitals [Layer 3 - Typography]
**IF** setting a headline **THEN** use upper and lower case, not all caps.
> "Capitals retard reading. They have no ascenders or descenders to help you recognize words, and tend to be read letter by letter."

### DR-33: No Period at End of Headlines [Layer 3 - Typography]
**IF** writing a headline **THEN** do not put a period at the end.
> "Periods are also called full stops, because they stop the reader dead in his tracks."

### DR-34: Use Drop-Initials [Layer 3 - Typography]
**IF** starting body copy **THEN** use a drop-initial.
> "If you start your body copy with a drop-initial, you increase readership by an average of 13 per cent."

### DR-35: Use Cross-Heads Throughout [Layer 3 - Typography]
**IF** writing long copy **THEN** insert cross-heads every two or three inches.
> "Cross-heads keep the reader marching forward. Make some of them interrogative, to excite curiosity in the next run of copy."

### DR-36: Line-Spacing Between Paragraphs [Layer 3 - Typography]
**IF** setting long copy **THEN** add leading between paragraphs.
> "If you use leading (line-spacing) between paragraphs, you increase readership by an average of 12 per cent."

### DR-37: Use Readable Type Size [Layer 3 - Typography]
**IF** choosing type size **THEN** use approximately 11-point.
> "This is 11-point, and about right."

### DR-38: Product Positioning Comes First [Layer 1 - Strategy]
**IF** starting a campaign **THEN** decide positioning before writing.
> "'What the product does, and who it is for.' I could have positioned Dove as a detergent bar for men with dirty hands, but chose instead to position it as a toilet bar for women with dry skin."

### DR-39: Build a Consistent Brand Image [Layer 1 - Strategy]
**IF** writing any advertisement **THEN** treat it as a contribution to the long-term brand image.
> "Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the brand image."
> "It pays to give most products an image of quality -- a First Class ticket."

### DR-40: Make the Product the Hero [Layer 1 - Strategy]
**IF** possible **THEN** make the product itself the hero of your advertising.
> "Whenever you can, make the product itself the hero of your advertising. If you think the product too dull, I have news for you: there are no dull products, only dull writers."

### DR-41: Repeat Winners Until They Stop Selling [Layer 1 - Strategy]
**IF** you have a good advertisement **THEN** keep running it.
> "If you are lucky enough to write a good advertisement, repeat it until it stops selling."
> "Research shows that the readership of an advertisement does not decline when it is run several times in the same magazine. Readership remains at the same level throughout at least four repetitions."
> "You aren't advertising to a standing army; you are advertising to a moving parade."

### DR-42: The Big Idea Test [Layer 1 - Strategy]
**IF** evaluating whether you have a Big Idea **THEN** ask five questions:
1. Did it make me gasp when I first saw it?
2. Do I wish I had thought of it myself?
3. Is it unique?
4. Does it fit the strategy to perfection?
5. Could it be used for 30 years?

### DR-43: Sex Must Be Relevant [Layer 2 - Content]
**IF** tempted to use sex in advertising **THEN** only if relevant to the product.
> "The test is relevance. To show bosoms in a detergent advertisement would not sell the detergent."

### DR-44: Promise Selection via Research [Layer 1 - Strategy]
**IF** choosing a promise for your product **THEN** test multiple promises.
> "The selection of the promise is the most valuable contribution that research can make to the advertising process."
> "Try to find a promise which is not only persuasive, but also unique."

### DR-45: Open TV Commercials with Fire [Layer 2 - TV]
**IF** making a TV commercial **THEN** grab attention in the first frame.
> "If you grab attention in the first frame with a visual surprise, you stand a better chance of holding the viewer."
> "When you advertise fire-extinguishers, open with the fire."

### DR-46: Use Supers in TV [Layer 2 - TV]
**IF** making a TV commercial **THEN** reinforce your promise by superimposing text over video while the soundtrack speaks the same words.
> "It pays to reinforce your promise by setting it in type and superimposing it over the video."
> "Make sure that the words in your supers are exactly the same as your spoken words."

### DR-47: Brand Name in First 10 Seconds of TV [Layer 2 - TV]
**IF** making a TV commercial **THEN** use the brand name within the first ten seconds.
> "Use the name within the first ten seconds."

### DR-48: Show the Package at End of TV [Layer 2 - TV]
**IF** making a TV commercial **THEN** end by showing the package.
> "Commercials which end by showing the package are more effective in changing brand preference than commercials which don't."

### DR-49: On-Camera Voice Beats Voice-Over [Layer 2 - TV]
**IF** choosing between voice-over and on-camera **THEN** prefer on-camera.
> "Research shows that it is more difficult to hold your audience if you use voice-over. It is better to have the actors talk on camera."

### DR-50: Never Stop Advertising in Recession [Layer 1 - Strategy]
**IF** in a recession **THEN** do not cut your advertising budget.
> "Studies of the last six recessions have demonstrated that companies which do not cut back their advertising budgets achieve greater increases in profit than companies which do cut back."

## 2. FORMULAS & TEMPLATES

### F-01: The Rolls-Royce Formula (Factual Long-Copy)
Structure: Specific factual headline + numbered factual points + price + call to action.
Example: "At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock" followed by 607 words of factual copy with 13 numbered details.

### F-02: The Two Ogilvy Layouts
**Layout 1 (Image-Dominant):** Large photograph on top, headline up to 9 words below, 240 words of copy. "Recommended when your illustration is to carry the main load of selling."
**Layout 2 (Copy-Dominant):** Wide shallow photograph, headline up to 20 words, subhead up to 28 words, 4-5 cross-heads, 600 words of body copy. "Recommended when your copy is more important than your illustration."

### F-03: Editorial-Format Ad Template
Mimic news magazine format:
- Copy has priority over illustration
- Copy set in serif type
- Three columns, 35-45 characters wide
- Every photograph has a caption
- Copy starts with drop-initials
- Type set black on white

### F-04: The Positively Good Framework
For parity products where your product is no better than competitors:
> "Just say what's good about your product -- and do a clearer, more honest, more informative job of saying it."
> "Sales will swing to the marketer who does the best job of creating confidence that his product is positively good."

### F-05: Direct Response TV Formula

- Repeat toll-free number at least twice
- Best times: early morning, late evening, weekends
- Best months: January, February, March

### F-06: Long Copy Typography Boosters
1. Subhead of two lines between headline and body
2. Drop-initial to start body (increases readership 13%)
3. Opening paragraph maximum 11 words
4. Cross-heads every 2-3 inches (make some interrogative)
5. Short "widow" lines (increase readership vs. squared-up paragraphs)
6. Bold face or italic for key paragraphs
7. Arrowheads, bullets, asterisks for paragraph entry
8. Numbered lists for unrelated facts
9. 11-point type
10. Leading between paragraphs (increases readership 12%)

### F-07: Direct Mail Testing Hierarchy
Test in this priority order:

4. Premiums
5. Format of mailing
Test one variable at a time. Treat the winner as "control" and test ways to beat it.

## 3. PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### P-01: The 5x Headline Rule [Layer 0]
> "On the average, five times as many people read the headlines as read the body copy. It follows that unless your headline sells your product, you have wasted 90 per cent of your money."

### P-02: Brand Image Theory [Layer 1]
> "Products, like people, have personalities, and they can make or break them in the market place."
> "Give people a taste of Old Crow, and tell them it's Old Crow. Then give them another taste of Old Crow, but tell them it's Jack Daniel's. Ask them which they prefer. They'll think the two drinks are quite different. They are tasting images."
> "The brand image is 90 per cent of what the distiller has to sell."

### P-03: The Big Idea [Layer 1]
> "You can do homework from now until doomsday, but you will never win fame and fortune unless you also invent big ideas."
> "I doubt if more than one campaign in a hundred contains a big idea."
> "Big ideas come from the unconscious. This is true in art, in science and in advertising. But your unconscious has to be well informed."
> Process: "Stuff your conscious mind with information, then unhook your rational thought process. You can help this process by going for a long walk, or taking a hot bath, or drinking half a pint of claret."

### P-04: Research-First Approach [Layer 0]
> "Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."
> Process: 1) Study product extensively 2) Study competitor advertising 3) Research consumers -- language, attributes, promise testing 4) Position 5) Decide brand image 6) Find the Big Idea.

### P-05: Salesmanship in Print [Layer 0]
> Definition from John E. Kennedy, via Lasker: Advertising is "salesmanship in print."
> "I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information."
> "When Aeschines spoke, they said, 'How well he speaks.' But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, 'Let us march against Philip.'"

### P-06: The Moving Parade [Layer 1]
> "You aren't advertising to a standing army; you are advertising to a moving parade. The advertisement which sold a refrigerator to couples who got married last year will probably be just as successful with couples who get married this year."

### P-07: The Consumer Is Not a Moron [Layer 0]
> "The consumer is not a moron, she is your wife."
> "It is often charged that advertising can persuade people to buy inferior products. So it can -- once. But the consumer perceives that the product is inferior and never buys it again."

### P-08: Promise, Large Promise [Layer 1]
> Samuel Johnson: "'Promise, large promise is the soul of an advertisement.'"
> "When he auctioned off the contents of the Anchor Brewery he made the following promise: 'We are not here to sell boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich beyond the dreams of avarice.'"

### P-09: Story Appeal in Photographs [Layer 3]
> "Photographs with an element of 'story appeal' were far above average in attracting attention. This led me to put an eye-patch on the model in my advertisements for Hathaway shirts."

### P-10: Advertising as Production Cost [Layer 1]
> "I have come to regard advertising as part of the product, to be treated as a production cost, not a selling cost. It follows that it should not be cut back when times are hard."

### P-11: The Repertory of Brands [Layer 1]
> "Consumers do not buy one brand of soap, or coffee, or detergent. They have a repertory of four or five brands, and move from one to another."
> "They almost never buy a brand which has not been admitted to their repertory during its first year on the market."
> Implication: "Your launch advertising is a matter of life and death."

### P-12: Heavy Users Principle [Layer 1]
> "Thirty-two per cent of beer-drinkers drink 80 per cent of all beer."
> "In everything you do, keep your eye glued to the heavy users."

---

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS

### AP-01: Creativity Without Sales [Layer 0]
> "If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative." (Benton & Bowles)
> "Of 81 television classics picked by the Clio festival in previous years, 36 of the agencies involved had either lost the account or gone out of business."

### AP-02: Irrelevant Sex [Layer 2]
> "The first advertisement I ever produced showed a naked woman. It was a mistake, not because it was sexy, but because it was irrelevant to the product -- a cooking stove."

### AP-03: Committee-Designed Campaigns [Layer 0]
> "Many commercials and many advertisements look like the minutes of a committee."
> "Search the parks in all your cities / You'll find no statues of committees."

### AP-04: Relying on Intuition Over Knowledge [Layer 0]
> "'Suppose your gall-bladder has to be removed this evening. Will you choose a surgeon who has read some books on anatomy and knows where to find your gall-bladder, or a surgeon who relies on his intuition?'"

### AP-05: Reverse Type [Layer 3]
> "I recently counted 49 advertisements set in reverse (white type on black background) in one issue of a magazine, long years after research demonstrated that reverse is difficult to read."

### AP-06: All-Capital Headlines [Layer 3]
> "Professor Tinker of Stanford has established that capitals retard reading."

### AP-07: Ignoring Captions [Layer 3]
> "Four times as many people read captions as read body copy" -- yet most art directors don't write them.

### AP-08: Too Many Objectives [Layer 1]
> "Most campaigns are too complicated. They reflect a long list of objectives, and try to reconcile the divergent views of too many executives. By attempting to cover too many things, they achieve nothing."

### AP-09: Changing Good Ads Too Soon [Layer 1]
> "Scores of good advertisements have been discarded before they lost their potency."

### AP-10: Short-Term Promotions Over Advertising [Layer 1]
> "The manufacturer who finds himself up the creek is the short-sighted opportunist who siphons off his advertising dollars for short-term promotions."
> "Sales are a function of product-value and advertising. Promotions cannot produce more than a temporary kink in the sales curve."

### AP-11: Celebrity Testimonials [Layer 2]
> "Testimonials by celebrities are below average in their ability to change brand preference."
> "Viewers have a way of remembering the celebrity while forgetting the product."

### AP-12: Cartoons for Adults [Layer 2]
> "Cartoons can sell things to children, but they are below average in selling to grown-ups."

### AP-13: Musical Vignettes [Layer 2]
> "Musical vignettes, with a parade of fleeting impressions... Entertaining, perhaps, but impotent if you want to sell."

### AP-14: Naming Competitors [Layer 2]
> "Commercials which name competing brands are less believable and more confusing than commercials which don't."

### AP-15: Background Music [Layer 2]
> "Research shows that this is neither a positive nor a negative factor."
> "Do great preachers allow organists to play background music under their sermons?"

### AP-16: Too Many Scene Changes in TV [Layer 2]
> "Commercials with a plethora of short scenes are below average in changing brand preference."

### AP-17: Artdirectoritis [Layer 3]
> "Those afflicted with this disease speak in hushed voices of 'cool grey bands of type,' as if the copy in advertisements was a mere design element."
> Cure: "KISS -- an acronym for Keep It Simple, Stupid."

### AP-18: Fatuous Corporate Slogans [Layer 2]
> "All these bromides are interchangeable -- any company could use any of them."
> Examples: "The resourceful company", "People building transportation to serve PEOPLE", "We're involved."

### AP-19: Changing the Agency Name to Initials [Layer 1]
> "Whatever you do, for goodness sake, don't change the name of your corporation to initials."
> "It will take them many years and many millions of dollars to teach their initials to their publics."

### AP-20: Jingles Without Clarity [Layer 2]
> "Never use a jingle without trying it on people who have not read your script. If they cannot decipher the words, don't put your jingle on the air."
> "If you went into a store and asked a salesman to show you a refrigerator, how would you react if he started singing at you?"

## 5. CONCRETE EXAMPLES (Famous Campaigns)

### E-01: Rolls-Royce -- "At 60 miles an hour..."
Headline discovered during three weeks of product research. Ran in only two newspapers and two magazines for $25,000. Established the factual long-copy formula. Ford subsequently based their multi-million dollar campaign on claiming their car was even quieter.

### E-02: Hathaway Shirts -- The Man with the Eyepatch
Inspired by Harold Rudolph's research on "story appeal" in photographs. The eyepatch gave a mysterious narrative quality. Ran from 1951 and was "still going strong" decades later.

### E-03: Schweppes -- Commander Whitehead
Used the face of the actual client (Commander Whitehead) as the symbol of the brand for 18 years. "It worked to beat the band on a peppercorn budget." Whitehead became a TV talk show celebrity.

### E-04: Dove -- "Creams your skin while you bathe"
Positioned as toilet bar for women with dry skin (not as detergent bar for dirty hands). Used a promise that won in test. "This is still working 25 years later."

### E-05: Volkswagen -- "Think Small" / "Lemon"
Created by Doyle Dane Bernbach (Bill Bernbach). Positioned VW as a protest against Detroit vulgarity. Made the Beetle a cult among non-conformists. "Sales of the car went up to 500,000 cars a year."

### E-06: Avis -- "We Try Harder"
Created by Doyle Dane Bernbach. "When you're only Number 2, you try harder. Or else." "This diabolical positioning made life miserable for Hertz."

### E-07: Marlboro -- The Cowboy
Created by Leo Burnett. "Climbed from obscurity to become the biggest-selling cigarette in the world." Running for 25+ years.

### E-08: Merrill Lynch -- "Bullish on America"
A herd of bulls parading through commercials. Ogilvy initially thought it was "dopey" but it ran for decades after the account moved.

### E-09: Puerto Rico Economic Development
Ogilvy's first Puerto Rico ad contained 600 words. "Fourteen thousand readers sent in the coupon, and scores of them built factories in Puerto Rico." Research changed the image from "dirty, ugly and squalid" to "beautiful and romantic."

### E-10: Shell Gasoline -- Platformate
A briefing revealed gasoline has several ingredients including Platformate which increases mileage. "The resulting campaign helped to reverse a seven-year decline in Shell's share-of-market."

### E-11: Pepperidge Farm -- Horse-Drawn Van
Ogilvy dreamed of two white horses pulling a baker's delivery van. "Today, 27 years later, that horse-drawn van is still driving up that lane in Pepperidge commercials."

### E-12: Mercedes-Benz -- Factual Campaign
Sent a team to Stuttgart for three weeks of taped interviews with engineers. "A campaign of long, factual advertisements which increased Mercedes sales in the United States from 10,000 cars a year to 40,000."
