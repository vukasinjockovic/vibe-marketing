When I write an advertisement, I don’t want you to tell me that you find it ‘creative.’ I want you to find it so interesting that you buy the product. When Aeschines spoke, they said, ‘How well he speaks.’ But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, ‘Let us march against Philip.’\n\n\r\n In my Confessions of an Advertising Man , published in 1963, I told the story of how Ogilvy & Mather came into existence, and set forth the principles on which our early success had been based. What was then little more than a creative boutique in New York has since become one of the four biggest advertising agencies in the world, with 140 offices in 40 countries.

All too often they attribute your commercial to a competing brand.\n\n\r\n Many copywriters think it crass to belabor the name of the product. However, for the benefit of those who are more interested in selling than entertaining, here are two ways to register your brand name:\n\n\r\n \r\n Use the name within the first ten seconds. I have seen a brilliant commercial which repeated the brand name twenty times in 340 seconds, without irritating anyone.\n\n\r\n Play games with the name. Spell it. Veterans will remember Alex Templeton, the blind pianist, spelling out the name C.R.E.S.T.A. B.L.A.N.C.A. to the accompaniment of pizzicato strings.\n\n\r\n\n\r\n When you advertise a new product, you have to teach people its name on television.",

Commercials which end by showing the package are more effective in changing brand preference than commercials which don’t.\n\n\r\n 3 Food in motion. In commercials for food, the more appetizing you make it look, the more you sell. It has been found that food in motion looks particularly appetizing. Show chocolate sauce in the act of being poured over your ice cream, or syrup over your pancakes.\n\n\r\n 4 Close-ups. It is a good thing to use close-ups when your product is the hero of your commercial. The closer you get on the candy bar, the more you make people’s mouths water.\n\n\r\n 5 Open with the fire.

There have been some successful commercials which sang the sales pitch, but jingles are below average in changing brand preference.\n\n\r\n Never use a jingle without trying it on people who have not read your script. If they cannot decipher the words, don’t put your jingle on the air.\n\n\r\n If you went into a store and asked a salesman to show you a refrigerator, how would you react if he started singing at you?

Most of them slide off the memory like water off a duck’s back. For this reason you should give your commercials a touch of singularity, a visual burr that will stick in the viewer’s mind.

Example: the car driving through the paper barrier in Shell commercials.\n\n\r\n 13 Show the product in use. It pays to show the product being used, and, if possible, the end-result of using it.

In 1979 Professor Jacoby of Purdue University studied the ‘miscomprehension’ of 25 typical television commercials.

Says Hooper White, ‘Production dollars are typed into the commercial by the copywriter and drawn into the commercial by the art director.’ Miner Raymond of Procter & Gamble tells the story of an art director who objected to a table on the set. The client pointed out that it was covered by a cloth and thus invisible. ‘But I would know what’s under the cloth’ said the art director, ‘and it just wouldn’t be right.’ So another table was found and the delay cost the client $5,000. 1 \n\n\r\n The easiest way to reduce the cost of a commercial is to cut actors out of the storyboard.

Worst of all, they use expensive celebrities when an unknown actor would sell more of the product.\n\n\r\n I have no research to prove it, but I suspect that there is a negative correlation between the money spent on producing commercials and their power to sell products.

How do you differentiate your bolts, washers or machine tools from those of your competitors? But, says Professor Levitt, ‘there is no such thing as a commodity. All goods and services are differentiable.’\n\n\r\n In a Harvard Business Review article, Professor William K. Hall reported on a study of eight industries, from steel to beer. The most successful companies were those that best differentiated their product or service.\n\n\r\n According to Professor Hall, the most successful commodity products differentiated themselves in one of two ways: either by low cost or by having the best reputation for quality or service.

Others – particularly in Great Britain – advertise ‘to keep their name before the public’. Others because it helps them to get distribution. Only a minority of marketers advertise because they have found that it increases their profits. \n\n\r\n On a train journey to California, a friend asked Mr. Wrigley why, with the lion’s share of the market, he continued to advertise his chewing gum. ‘How fast do you think this train is going?’ asked Wrigley. ‘I would say about ninety miles an hour’ ‘Well,’ said Wrigley, ‘do you suggest we unhitch the engine?’ ",

It would cost you $25,000 to have salesmen call on a thousand homes. A television commercial can do it for $4.69.

Ehrenberg of the London Business School has established that consumers do not buy one brand of soap, or coffee, or detergent. They have a repertory of four or five brands, and move from one to another. They almost never buy a brand which has not been admitted to their repertory during its first year on the market.\n\n\r\n Dr. Ehrenberg goes on to argue that the only thing you can expect from post- launch advertising is that it will persuade present users to buy your brand more often than the others in their repertory.",

Whether people approved of Chicago or not, it was “family”, rather like a son who had gone off and made good in an impressive but controversial way.

Said Leo Burnett, the great Chicago advertising man: ‘Advertising is not the noblest creation of man’s mind, as so many of its advocates would like the public to think. It does not, single-handedly, sustain the whole structure of capitalism and democracy and the Free World. It is just as nonsensical to suggest that we are superhuman as to accept the indictment that we are subhuman.
