## 1. DECISION RULES

### DR-01: Customer as Hero, Not Brand
**Type:** Positioning | **Layer:** 0
IF you are writing any marketing message THEN position the customer as the hero and the brand as the guide.
> "Your customer should be the hero of the story, not your brand. This is the secret every phenomenally successful business understands."
> "Position yourself as Yoda and your audience as Luke Skywalker." (Nancy Duarte via Miller)

### DR-02: When to Define What the Customer Wants
**Type:** Message architecture | **Layer:** 1
IF you have not defined a single, clear desire the customer has THEN the story has no starting point and the customer will not engage.
> "Unless we identify something our customer wants, they will never feel invited into the story we are creating."
Rule: Pare the desire down to ONE focus. "Human beings cannot hold large amounts of new information in their heads at once."

### DR-03: Survival Connection Required
**Type:** Desire selection | **Layer:** 1
IF the desire you define is not connected to a survival mechanism THEN customers will not feel urgency.
Survival categories: conserving financial resources, conserving time, building social networks, gaining status, accumulating resources, showing generosity, desiring meaning.
> "People will always choose a story that helps them survive and thrive."

### DR-04: Talk About Problems to Deepen Interest
**Type:** Engagement | **Layer:** 1
IF you want to deepen customer interest beyond initial curiosity THEN talk about the problems they face.
> "The more we talk about the problems our customers experience, the more curiosity they will have about our brand."

### DR-05: Three Levels of Problem -- Always Address Internal
**Type:** Problem framing | **Layer:** 2
IF you only address external problems THEN you miss the deeper motivator.
> "Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but people buy solutions to internal problems."
Formula: Villain causes EXTERNAL problem -> which makes customer FEEL something (INTERNAL) -> which is simply wrong (PHILOSOPHICAL).

### DR-06: Villain Characteristics
**Type:** Problem framing | **Layer:** 2
IF defining a villain THEN it must be: (1) a root source, not a symptom, (2) relatable, (3) singular, (4) real.
> "The villain is the number one device storytellers use to give conflict a clear point of focus."

### DR-07: When to Express Empathy vs Competency
**Type:** Guide positioning | **Layer:** 2
IF positioning as guide THEN demonstrate TWO characteristics: empathy first, then competency.
Empathy = "We understand how it feels to..." / Competency = testimonials, statistics, awards, press mentions, logos.
> "When we empathize with our customers' dilemma, we create a bond of trust."
> Amy Cuddy research: People ask "Can I trust this person?" (empathy) then "Can I respect this person?" (competency).

### DR-08: When to Use a Process Plan vs Agreement Plan
**Type:** Plan selection | **Layer:** 2
IF the customer's barrier is CONFUSION about next steps THEN use a process plan (3-6 steps).
IF the customer's barrier is FEAR of doing business THEN use an agreement plan (list of promises).
> "If process plans are about alleviating confusion, agreement plans are about alleviating fears."

### DR-09: Direct vs Transitional CTA
**Type:** Call to action | **Layer:** 2
IF the customer is ready to buy THEN use a direct CTA ("Buy Now," "Schedule a Call," "Register Today").
IF the customer needs more trust THEN use a transitional CTA (free PDF, webinar, sample, free trial).
> "A transitional call to action is like asking your customer, 'Can I take you out on a date?' and a direct call to action is like popping the question, 'Will you marry me?'"

### DR-10: How Much Failure/Negative Stakes to Include
**Type:** Stakes calibration | **Layer:** 2
IF you use zero negative stakes THEN the story has no urgency and customers won't act.
IF you use too many THEN customers become numb and disengage.
Rule: "Fear is salt in the recipe." Use moderate amounts. "When I am slightly uncomfortable with the negativity of my message, I add a little more and then stop."
> "Messages containing moderate amounts of fear-rousing content are most effective."

### DR-11: Success Must Close All Three Story Loops
**Type:** Resolution | **Layer:** 2
IF you want maximum satisfaction THEN resolve external, internal, AND philosophical problems in a single scene/message.
> "When all three levels of conflict were resolved at once, the audience felt three levels of relief."

### DR-12: Identity Transformation Trumps Product Features
**Type:** Aspirational identity | **Layer:** 3
IF you want brand evangelists THEN define who the customer BECOMES after engaging your brand (From X -> To Y).
> "Brands that realize their customers are human, filled with emotion, driven to transform, and in need of help truly do more than sell products; they change people."

### DR-13: Controlling Idea Must Be Singular and Repeatable
**Type:** Message discipline | **Layer:** 1
IF your messaging lacks a single controlling idea THEN customers cannot repeat your message to others.
> "Good messaging is an exercise in memorization, meaning you are trying to get your customer to memorize your controlling idea so they can repeat it to their friends."

### DR-14: The Grunt Test
**Type:** Validation | **Layer:** 0
IF a caveman cannot look at your website and grunt back (1) what you offer, (2) how it makes life better, (3) what to do to buy it THEN your message fails.
> "Could a caveman look at your website and immediately grunt your offer back to you?"

### DR-15: Repetition is the Strategy
**Type:** Campaign execution | **Layer:** 1
IF you have clear sound bites THEN repeat them 8+ times across every channel until customers can recite them back.
> "People have to read or hear your message about eight times before they internalize and respond."

## 3. PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### P-01: The Survival Mechanism
**Type:** Principle | **Layer:** 0
The brain's overriding function is to help an individual survive and thrive. All marketing messages are subconsciously scanned for survival relevance. Messages that don't connect to survival are categorized as "chairs" (ignorable), not "exits" (essential).
> "What Mike helped me understand is that, without us knowing it, human beings are constantly scanning their environment (even advertising) for information that is going to help them meet their primitive need to survive."

### P-02: The Noise Problem
**Type:** Principle | **Layer:** 0
Noise kills more businesses than any other force. Marketing that is confusing, irrelevant, or self-focused is noise. The brain burns calories processing information and will tune out anything that doesn't serve survival.
> "Noise has killed more ideas, products, and services than taxes, recessions, lawsuits, climbing interest rates, and even inferior product design."

### P-03: Story as Sense-Making Device
**Type:** Mechanism | **Layer:** 0
Story organizes information so the brain doesn't have to work to understand what's going on. It is a "sense-making mechanism" that follows predictable patterns. The seven-part structure is the "pinnacle of narrative communication."
> "Story formulas put everything in order so the brain doesn't have to work to understand what's going on."

### P-04: The Story Gap
**Type:** Mechanism | **Layer:** 1
When you define something a customer wants but doesn't yet have, you open a "story gap." Attention rises when a gap opens and falls when it closes. Opening and closing gaps drives all human behavior and every dollar spent.
> "Attention rises and lowers with the opening and closing of a story gap."

### P-05: If You Confuse, You Lose
**Type:** Principle | **Layer:** 0
The StoryBrand mantra. The human brain is drawn toward clarity and away from confusion. Pretty websites don't sell -- words sell. Clear words.
> "The human brain, no matter what region of the world it comes from, is drawn toward clarity and away from confusion."

### P-06: Brands That Play Hero Lose
**Type:** Principle | **Layer:** 1
When a brand positions itself as the hero, customers perceive competition for scarce resources. The customer's subconscious says: "This is another hero, like me. I wish I had more time to hear their story, but right now I'm busy looking for a guide."
> "The day we stop losing sleep over our problems and start losing sleep over our customers' problems is the day our business will transform."

### P-07: Loss Aversion > Gain
**Type:** Mechanism | **Layer:** 1
From Daniel Kahneman's Prospect Theory: people are 2-3x more motivated to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain. Therefore defining what customers LOSE by not buying is more powerful than defining what they gain.

### P-08: Cognitive Dissonance Kills Sales
**Type:** Mechanism | **Layer:** 2
Even excited customers won't buy if they experience cognitive dissonance about HOW the process works. A plan (3-6 steps) removes this dissonance by placing "stones in the creek."
> "When a customer is deciding whether to buy something, we should picture them standing on the edge of a large, rushing creek."

### P-09: Messaging as Memorization Exercise
**Type:** Principle | **Layer:** 1
Your communication campaign is an exercise in memorization. Repeat the same sound bites in the same words across every channel until customers can recite them back to others. If your sound bites change, you start over.

### P-10: The Guide Archetype
**Type:** Principle | **Layer:** 1
Guides are strong, competent, and all-knowing. The story is not about them, but they get significant screen time. They serve the hero's story. Two traits: empathy (trust) and competency (respect). The guide should never transform -- only the hero transforms.
> "Mary Poppins does not explain herself to anybody."

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS

### AP-01: Making the Brand the Hero
The most common and fatal mistake. When you talk about your mission, your backstory, your founding story, your awards as if you are the protagonist, customers tune out.
> "To position yourself as a hero is a mistake."

### AP-02: Too Many Messages / Too Many Words
Websites with paragraphs above the fold, elevator pitches that ramble, emails that tell the company story. "People don't read websites; they scan them." Write in Morse code: brief, punchy, relevant.

### AP-03: No Clear Call to Action
Using "learn more" or "get started" instead of "Buy Now." Being passive about asking for the order. "Companies that don't make their calls to action clear remind me of my dating days."

### AP-04: Missing the Villain
If there is no villain, the problem has no root cause and no focal point. Customers have no enemy to rally against.

### AP-05: Only Addressing External Problems
Selling the leaky pipe fix without addressing how embarrassed the customer feels. "Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but people buy solutions to internal problems."

### AP-06: No Stakes Defined
If nothing can be gained or lost, nobody cares. A story without stakes loses the audience. "Brands that don't paint the stakes fail to answer the 'so what' question."

### AP-07: Vague Success Vision
"We help you succeed" is not specific. "A yard that looks better than your neighbor's" is specific. Paint the exact picture.

### AP-08: No Plan (Cognitive Dissonance)
Expecting customers to figure out how to buy from you or adopt your product without spelling out 3-6 steps.

### AP-09: Positioning Others' Story as Yours (The Tidal Mistake)
Jay-Z positioned artists as the heroes fighting for their cause but forgot customers were the ones buying the music. "How are you helping ME win the day?"

### AP-10: Sharing Your Backstory First
"Fifty years ago my grandfather..." Nobody cares. Define the customer's desire and problem first.

### AP-11: Website as Information Dump
A thousand links, FAQ, timeline, nonprofit work, job opportunities -- all answering questions no customer is asking.

## 5. CONCRETE EXAMPLES

### E-01: Spectrum Brands -- "Kids Love Aquariums"
Three words added to packaging. 99% increase in sales in test market. Connected to survival: family bonding, passing love to children.

### E-02: Kyle Shultz -- Photography Course
Rewrote sales page night before launch using SB7. Removed 90% of text. Replaced jargon ("f-stop", "depth of field") with "Take those great pictures where the background is blurry." Went from $25K to $103K to the SAME email list.

### E-03: Nicole Burke -- Gardenary / StartAGarden.com
Changed from "make gardening ordinary" (her mission) to "Start a Garden" (customer's desire). Poised to quadruple revenue.

### E-04: Industrial Painting Company
Original: Fine-arts painting of building, looked like Italian restaurant. Proposed: Image of guy in white lab coat + "We Paint All Kinds of S#*%" + "Get a Quote" button.

### E-05: Luxury Resort
Changed from images of building/front desk/staff to warm bath, plush towels, massage, rocking chair. Header: "Find the luxury and rest you've been looking for."

### E-06: Tidal (Jay-Z) -- What NOT to Do
Positioned artists as heroes fighting for their own paychecks. Should have positioned fans as heroes getting "Music the way it was meant to be heard."

### E-07: Apple -- Think Different
From 9-page newspaper ad about technical features (Lisa, bombed) to 2 words on billboards (Think Different). Positioned customer as hero who wanted to be seen and heard.

### E-08: CarMax -- Solving Internal Fear
Doesn't advertise cars. Advertises resolution to fear of used car salesmen. Agreement plan: no haggling, quality certification, no variable commission.

### E-09: MaxStrength Fitness -- "Twenty Minutes, Twice"
Controlling idea buried at bottom of page. Should have been the header, repeated in every section, printed on merch.

### E-10: Vitality Aesthetics -- "Get Your Natural Beauty Back"
Changed from "Your Natural Beauty" to "Get Your Natural Beauty Back." Added downloadable price list as lead gen + 30 emails over 30 weeks telling transformation stories.

### E-11: Dave Ramsey -- Complete SB7 Execution
Returning tagline: "Debt is dumb, cash is king, and the paid-off home mortgage has taken the place of the BMW as the status symbol of choice." Debt-Free Scream = climactic scene. Affirms transformation post-journey.

### E-12: Gerber Knives -- "Hello Trouble"
Defined aspirational identity: tough, adventurous, fearless, action-oriented. Customer doesn't need the knife -- they need who the knife makes them FEEL like being.

### E-13: Calix Sales Training
250 account executives sent StoryBrand-formatted emails during 1-hour training session. Closed $2.5M+ in sales.

## 6. AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

### AI-01: Creating a BrandScript (Step by Step)

   - Write it in plain language (not jargon).

2. DEFINE THE PROBLEM
   - Ask: "What villain is causing this problem?"
   - Define EXTERNAL problem (tangible thing)
   - Ask: "What does this problem make our customer FEEL?" -> INTERNAL problem
   - Ask: "Why is it WRONG that people should suffer this?" -> PHILOSOPHICAL problem (use "ought" / "shouldn't")

3. VALUE PROPOSITION:
   - Expanded offer. Swing back to positive.
   - Can include testimonial or bullet benefits

4. GUIDE SECTION:
   - Brief empathy + competency
   - Photo of founder/team (optional)

   - All other links (about, FAQ, careers, social)
```

### AI-03: Applying SB7 to an Email Sequence

```
NURTURE EMAILS (3 in a row):
  P1: Problem the reader faces
  P2: Plan/idea/recipe that solves it (give value freely)
  P3: What life looks like with problem solved
  P4: Summarize into 3 steps
  PS: One punchy line (often the only part read)

SALES EMAIL (every 4th):
  P1: Customer's problem
  P2: Your product as solution
  P3: Life after purchase
  P4: Price, discount, CTA -- be direct
  PS: Urgency or scarcity element
```

### AI-04: Writing a One-Liner

```
1. Start with the PROBLEM (the hook):
   "If you're a busy mom and can't find time to work out..."
   "Most small business owners waste money on marketing that doesn't work..."

2. Name the SOLUTION (keep it brief):
   "...we created [Product Name]..."
   "...that's why we built [Product Name]..."

3. Describe the RESULT:
   "...so you can get fit in just 20 minutes from home."
   "...so your customers finally understand what you offer and place orders."

Test: Does it make someone ask for your card or ask "How much?"
If not, keep editing.
```

### AI-05: Writing Ad Copy with SB7

```
1. Open with PROBLEM or VILLAIN (the hook)
2. Introduce your brand as GUIDE (empathy + competency in 1-2 lines)
3. State the PLAN (simplified to 1-2 steps)
4. Paint SUCCESS (specific vision)
5. End with DIRECT CTA

Keep it under 100 words for digital ads.
For longer-form (email, landing page), expand each section.
```
