## 1. DECISION RULES

### DR-01: Traffic Temperature Determines Copy Approach
**IF** traffic is HOT (knows you, on your list) **THEN** use personality-driven communication, Seinfeld emails, direct product links. "You're going to talk to these people like they're your friends (because they are)."
**IF** traffic is WARM (knows someone who knows you, JV/affiliate) **THEN** use endorsement pre-frame + lift letter from list owner. "All that traffic needs is a little note of endorsement from a person they trust."
**IF** traffic is COLD (strangers) **THEN** use longer pre-frame bridge, general language, education-first approach. "Talk in terms that cold traffic will understand."
- Layer: 2 | Type: decision-rule

### DR-02: Traffic Temperature Determines Landing Page
**IF** cold traffic **THEN** send to pre-frame bridge page first (quiz, article, blog post, presell page), then landing page. Use problem-aware language.
**IF** warm traffic **THEN** send through JV email/endorsement directly to landing page. Use solution-aware language.
**IF** hot traffic **THEN** send direct email link to landing page. Use product-aware language.
- "If your prospect is aware of your product and has realized it can satisfy his desire, your headline starts with the product. If he is not aware of your product, but only of the desire itself, your headline starts with the desire. If he is not yet aware of what he really seeks, but is concerned with the general problem, your headline starts with the problem and crystallizes it into a specific need." (Gene Schwartz, cited by Brunson)
- Layer: 2 | Type: decision-rule

### DR-03: Funnel Type by Value Ladder Position
**IF** frontend (low-ticket, $0-$97) **THEN** use Two-Step Free-Plus-Shipping Funnel, SLO Funnel, or Continuity Funnel. Short scripts (Who/What/Why/How or Star/Story/Solution).
**IF** middle of ladder ($100-$2,000) **THEN** use Perfect Webinar Funnel, Invisible Funnel Webinar, or Product Launch Funnel. Longer scripts with content + close.
**IF** backend (high-ticket, $3,000+) **THEN** use High-Ticket Three-Step Application Funnel. Change selling environment to phone. Use two-person setter/closer script.
- Layer: 2 | Type: decision-rule

### DR-04: Email Sequence Selection
**IF** subscriber is NEW (just joined list) **THEN** send Soap Opera Sequence (5 emails, auto-responder). Purpose: build bond with Attractive Character fast.
**IF** subscriber has COMPLETED Soap Opera Sequence **THEN** move to daily Seinfeld emails (broadcast). Purpose: maintain relationship + sell daily.
- "My emails switched from 100% content to 90% entertainment and just 10% content, and my readership, opens, clicks, and sales all skyrocketed."
- Layer: 2 | Type: decision-rule

### DR-05: OTO Structure Selection
**IF** upselling after initial purchase **THEN** choose one of three structures:
1. "The Next Thing" -- what is the next logical product they need to reach their goal? (Best option)
2. "Do It Faster" -- tool/technique that speeds up results from initial purchase.
3. "Need Help?" -- push them to higher-ticket coaching/consulting.
**NEVER** sell more of the same thing. "The visitor's mind has already scratched that itch."
**NEVER** sell a random, unrelated product. "If there is no logical connection, you will kill your conversions."
- Layer: 2 | Type: decision-rule

### DR-06: Free-Plus-Shipping vs. Straight Sale
**IF** you can create a physical product (book, CD, DVD) **THEN** prefer free-plus-shipping. Gets 8x more buyers than $197 direct sale. "The power of free."
**IF** free-plus-shipping numbers don't work **THEN** switch to straight sale or trial. "We tried this with our neuropathy supplement, and the numbers never quite worked out. So we changed it to a straight sale, and it worked great."
- Layer: 2 | Type: decision-rule

### DR-07: Selling Environment Selection
**IF** product price < $2,000 **THEN** sell via online sales letter, webinar, or video.
**IF** product price $2,000-$25,000+ **THEN** change selling environment to phone call, direct mail, or live event. "Most prospects won't whip out a credit card and pay twenty-five thousand dollars based on a video sales letter alone."
- Layer: 3 | Type: decision-rule

### DR-08: Attractive Character Identity Selection
**IF** you have already achieved the result for your audience **THEN** use The Leader identity.
**IF** you are curious and bring back discoveries **THEN** use The Adventurer/Crusader identity.
**IF** you are new to the niche and learning **THEN** use The Reporter/Evangelist identity. "Becoming a reporter is a great way to start a business in a niche you don't know much about."
**IF** you are reluctant about the spotlight but feel moral duty to share **THEN** use The Reluctant Hero identity.
- Layer: 2 | Type: decision-rule

### DR-09: When to Use Each Pre-Frame Type
**IF** cold traffic from banner ads **THEN** use articles on third-party sites or presell pages.
**IF** any traffic + need segmentation **THEN** use quizzes (3-4 questions, agitate the problem).
**IF** current news event relates to product **THEN** use news-style pre-frame.
**IF** warm traffic from JV partner **THEN** use email endorsement (lift letter).
**IF** need social proof pre-frame **THEN** use YouTube testimonial videos.
- Layer: 2 | Type: decision-rule

### DR-10: Buyer Qualification Method
**IF** you have a physical product to ship **THEN** use free-plus-shipping (best for qualifying buyers).
**IF** digital product/software **THEN** use $1 trial or free account.
**IF** info-product splinter **THEN** use tripwire ($7 range).
**IF** product is $37-$97 **THEN** use self-liquidating offer.
- Layer: 2 | Type: decision-rule

## 2. FORMULAS & TEMPLATES

### F-01: The Secret Formula (4 Questions)
1. **Who** is your dream client? (Create detailed avatar with name, photo, characteristics)
2. **Where** can you find them? (Congregations: forums, Facebook groups, email lists, blogs)
3. **What bait** will you use to attract them? (Free report, book, CD -- must match dream client's desire)
4. **What result** do you want to give them? (Ultimate transformation, not just a product)
- Layer: 1 | Type: framework

### F-02: The Value Ladder
Structure: Left axis = Value provided, Bottom axis = Price charged. Top-right corner = highest value + highest price.
Levels (typical):
1. **Bait** (free or free-plus-shipping) -- attracts dream customer
2. **Frontend** ($7-$97) -- qualifies buyer
3. **Middle** ($100-$2,000) -- deeper engagement
4. **Backend** ($3,000-$100,000+) -- highest-level service
5. **Continuity** (recurring monthly) -- lifeblood of business
- "The Value Ladder is the key to building your marketing funnels."
- "There's no end to your Value Ladder."
- Layer: 1 | Type: framework

### F-03: Three Types of Traffic
1. **Traffic You Own** -- your email list, followers, subscribers. Best type. "I can send out an email, post a message to my followers, and I will generate instant traffic."
2. **Traffic You Control** -- paid ads (PPC, banners, solo ads, affiliates). Send to squeeze page.
3. **Traffic You Don't Control** -- organic, social, SEO, guest posts. Send to blog with squeeze page at top.
- **ONLY GOAL**: Convert all traffic into traffic you own. "The bigger your list, the more money you make."
- Rule of thumb: $1/month per email subscriber.
- Layer: 1 | Type: framework

### F-04: The Attractive Character (AC)
**Four Elements:**
1. **Backstory** -- where you came from; must relate to product. "If they can relate to where you came from, then they will want to follow you."
2. **Parables** -- teaching stories from AC's life. "When you stop teaching facts and start teaching through parables, your messages will stay with an audience longer."
3. **Character Flaws** -- vulnerabilities that make you relatable. "No one wants to hear about the perfect person."
4. **Polarity** -- take a stand, split audience into fans/neutrals/haters. "Being neutral is boring."

**Four Identities:**
1. The Leader -- has achieved the result, leads others on same path
2. The Adventurer/Crusader -- goes on journey, brings back treasures
3. The Reporter/Evangelist -- interviews experts, shares discoveries
4. The Reluctant Hero -- humble, shares secrets out of moral duty

**Six Storylines:**
1. Loss and Redemption
2. Us vs. Them
3. Before and After
4. Amazing Discovery
5. Secret Telling
6. Third-Person Testimonial
- Layer: 2 | Type: framework

### F-05: Soap Opera Sequence (5 Emails)
**Email #1: Set the Stage**
- Welcome, introduce AC, set expectations for email frequency
- Open a loop: tease what's coming tomorrow
- Example close: "Yes, I'm going to let you go through one of my BEST products for free"

**Email #2: Open with High Drama**
- Start at the point of high drama (NOT the beginning)
- Fill in backstory leading to a wall (where reader is now stuck)
- Open loop: promise the answer in email #3
- Include first soft CTA (optional free product link)

**Email #3: Epiphany**
- The moment everything changed
- Tie epiphany to the product you're selling
- "My epiphany was I needed to ___, and that's when I learned about ___"
- CTA to product

**Email #4: Hidden Benefits**
- Benefits reader didn't expect from following your path
- Use parables to demonstrate hidden benefits
- Stronger CTA with offer details

**Email #5: Urgency and CTA**
- Light a fire -- real urgency (limited seats, expiring offer, pulling video offline)
- "Fake urgency will backfire on you"
- Final strong CTA

**Key Rules:**
- Each email pulls reader to the next (open/close loops)
- 1-2 sentences per line, lots of white space
- Personality over perfection -- grammatical errors are OK
- Layer: 2 | Type: template

### F-06: Daily Seinfeld Email Formula
- 90% entertainment, 10% content
- Topics: embarrassing moments, daily life, opinions, stories, purchases, kid/pet antics, funny memories
- **EVERY email must tie back to a product or offer**
- "If you just send out entertaining emails and don't tie in your products or services, you won't make a dime."
- Send DAILY after Soap Opera Sequence completes
- These are broadcasts (not auto-responders)
- Double duty: copy-paste to blog for content
- Layer: 2 | Type: template

## 3. PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### P-01: The Business That Spends the Most Wins
"Ultimately, the business that can spend the most to acquire a customer wins." -- Dan Kennedy (cited repeatedly by Brunson)
- The entire book's architecture revolves around this: deeper funnels = higher customer value = ability to outspend competitors = more traffic = more customers.
- Layer: 0 | Type: principle

### P-02: It's a Funnel Problem, Not a Traffic Problem
"More often than not, it's a FUNNEL problem." When traffic or conversions seem broken, the real issue is the sales funnel isn't structured to maximize customer value.
- Layer: 1 | Type: principle

### P-03: A Buyer Is a Buyer Is a Buyer
"A buyer is a buyer is a buyer." (Dan Kennedy via Brunson) If someone buys once, they'll keep buying if you provide value. Qualify buyers immediately -- don't wait.
- Layer: 1 | Type: principle

### P-04: The Pre-Frame Controls Conversion
"The frame people enter your website through is probably the most important thing you can know." (Mark Joyner via Brunson) The experience BEFORE the landing page determines conversion more than the page itself.
- Layer: 1 | Type: principle

### P-05: Not All Clicks Are Created Equal
Where clicks come from matters more than the number of clicks. A positive pre-frame from a trusted source converts dramatically higher than cold banner ad traffic.
- Layer: 1 | Type: principle

### P-06: The Power of Free
"There was power in free!" -- Humans are irrationally attracted to free. Free-plus-shipping gets 8x more buyers than a $197 offer. Once the credit card is out, 25% buy the upsell.
- Layer: 1 | Type: principle

### P-07: Congregations Are Gold Veins
Dream customers already congregate online in forums, groups, newsletters, blogs. Your job is to find the congregation and put your message in front of them.
- Layer: 1 | Type: principle

### P-08: Model What Already Works
"Find someone else who is already doing what you want to do and model your efforts after theirs." (Tony Robbins via Brunson) Reverse engineer successful funnels before building your own.
- Layer: 1 | Type: principle

### P-09: Every Email Must Sell
Seinfeld emails are entertaining, but "EVERY EMAIL and each story must be tied back into some type of offer for your audience." Entertainment without a CTA makes zero dollars.
- Layer: 2 | Type: principle

### P-10: Open and Close Loops
From soap operas: open a story loop to create anticipation, close it in the next email while opening a new loop. This chains attention from email to email, episode to episode.
- Layer: 2 | Type: mechanism

### P-11: The Second Yes Is Easier Than the First
"Once you get someone to say the first yes, it's so much easier to get the second yes." This is why low-ticket frontend offers lead to high upsell conversion rates.
- Layer: 1 | Type: mechanism

### P-12: The Stack
"The only thing your prospect remembers when you sell is the last thing you showed him." Build the offer progressively with a Stack Slide -- each new component re-lists all previous ones. The final price is anchored against the full stacked value, not just the last bonus.
- Layer: 3 | Type: mechanism

### P-13: Hyperactive Buyers Exist in Every Market
People in acute pain will buy multiple things at once. Identify them with immediate upsells after initial purchase. "If you don't, they'll leave your site and go find another site to buy from."
- Layer: 2 | Type: principle

---

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS

### AP-01: No Value Ladder
Having only one product/service with no ascending offers. "This system does not work if all you have is one thing." FitLife.tv had no Value Ladder -- couldn't build a funnel -- couldn't profit.
- Layer: 1 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-02: Starting Without Reverse Engineering
Building funnels without first studying successful competitors. "I never start to build out any new sales funnel" without finding "other people who already have a successful funnel."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-03: Two Unknowns
Moving forward on a campaign when you don't know at least 4 of the 5 campaign variables (demographics, offer, landing page, traffic source, ad copy). "Never move forward with two unknowns."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-04: Same Pre-Frame for All Traffic
Sending hot, warm, and cold traffic to the same landing page with the same messaging. "Each group needs special treatment and individualized communication."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-05: Selling in Wrong Language
Talking to cold traffic using insider jargon they don't understand. "You're talking in a language they may not even understand." Use general terms for cold traffic, specific terms for hot.
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-06: Upselling More of the Same
Offering more of what the customer just bought. "In the visitor's mind, he has already scratched that itch."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-07: Random Upsells
Selling an unrelated product as an upsell with no logical connection to the frontend purchase.
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-08: Closing the Sales Loop Too Early
Saying "Congratulations, your order is complete" before presenting the OTO. This closes the mental loop. Instead: "Your order is not yet complete."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-09: Content Without CTA
Sending entertaining Seinfeld emails or content that never ties back to a product. "You won't make a dime. Not even if you're the best storyteller in the world."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-10: Fake Urgency
"Fake urgency will backfire on you, and you'll lose all credibility." Urgency must be real.
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-11: Being the Selling Person for Your High-Ticket
"You should not be the one selling directly on the phone; you're too close to the outcome emotionally, and it's just bad positioning." Use setter + closer.
- Layer: 3 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-12: Skipping the Pre-Frame
Going directly from ad to offer without pre-framing. "One big mistake many marketers make is focusing 100% on short-term conversions or monetization."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-13: No Continuity Program
"If you don't have continuity, then you don't have a business." (David Frey via Brunson)
- Layer: 1 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-14: Boring Neutral Attractive Character
"Instead of being a relatable person, speakers become bland and stay neutral on many topics... being neutral is boring."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

### AP-15: Waiting to Qualify Buyers
Waiting days or weeks after opt-in to present a purchase opportunity. "Don't wait a day or a week. Qualify buyers right away."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anti-pattern

## 5. CONCRETE EXAMPLES

### EX-01: The Dentist Value Ladder
Free teeth cleaning (bait) -> teeth whitening kit ($hundreds) -> retainers ($hundreds) -> cosmetic surgery ($thousands) -> 6-month continuity appointments. "I walked out paying over two thousand dollars for my whitening kit and my new retainers."
- Layer: 1 | Type: anecdote

### EX-02: FitLife.tv / Drew Canole
1.2M Facebook followers, spending $116 to sell $97 product. Problem: no Value Ladder, no funnel beyond initial product. Solution: restructured funnel to make 2-3x per sale, which enabled more ad spend.
- Layer: 1 | Type: anecdote

### EX-03: DotComSecrets Labs Book Funnel
Free-plus-shipping book (108 Proven Split Test Winners) -> $37 order form bump (Conversion Krusher) -> OTO #1 ($197 Instant Traffic Hacks) -> OTO #2 ($297 Perfect Webinar) -> OTO #3 ($997 High-Ticket Secrets). Average $66 revenue per free book given away.
- Layer: 2 | Type: anecdote

### EX-04: Brunson's Value Ladder
Free book -> home study courses -> live events -> $10K Ignite program -> $25K Inner Circle -> $100K+ million-dollar consulting. "We currently charge our clients one hundred thousand dollars plus 10% of their profits."
- Layer: 2 | Type: anecdote

### EX-05: Dr. Chad Woolner (Chiropractor)
Had only $50 adjustments. Added: free massage as frontend bait -> adjustments -> $5,000 wellness program as backend. Massage therapists trained to detect need for adjustments.
- Layer: 1 | Type: anecdote

### EX-06: Custom Suits / Free Cufflinks
Friend selling $2,000 custom suits couldn't find frontend. Gave away free cuff links online. Generated hundreds of leads within days.
- Layer: 1 | Type: anecdote

### EX-07: MicroContinuity Launch with Joy Anderson
Used Joy Anderson's story instead of his own. Sold 8,000+ units, over $1M in 2 weeks. Audience was 50/50 male/female (vs usual 90% male). "Almost without exception, all the women said, 'I want to be Joy Anderson.'"
- Layer: 2 | Type: anecdote

### EX-08: Invisible Funnel Webinar Numbers
550 registrations with credit cards -> 85% showed up (vs 30% normal) -> 90% agreed to pay $47 -> $23.5K from webinar alone -> additional six figures from coaching applications in next 30 days.
- Layer: 3 | Type: anecdote

### EX-09: One Hundred Visitor Test
100 visitors to $197 product page = 1 buyer = $197 revenue. 100 visitors to free-plus-shipping + $197 upsell = 8 buyers, 2 upsells = $394 revenue + 7x more buyers.
- Layer: 2 | Type: anecdote

### EX-10: Golf Guy Who Said No
Prospect sold 100K+ units on TV but couldn't figure out Internet. Refused coaching because "Russell doesn't know anything about golf." Brunson already had the complete competitive analysis done in 10 minutes. "That's a twenty-million-dollar-a-year blueprint that this dude just flushed down the toilet."

### AI-02: Email Sequence Template

Write 5 Soap Opera Sequence emails:
1. Set the Stage (welcome, tease tomorrow)
2. High Drama + Backstory (start at peak, go back, hit wall, open loop)
3. Epiphany (the turning point, link to product)
4. Hidden Benefits (unexpected upsides, stronger CTA)
5. Urgency + CTA (real scarcity, final push)

**After Soap Opera completes:**
Write daily Seinfeld emails:
