## 1. PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### P-01: The Channeling Principle (FOUNDATIONAL)
- **Type:** PRINCIPLE
- **Layer:** 0-foundational

> "The power, the force, the overwhelming urge to own that makes advertising work, comes from the market itself, and not from the copy. Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already-existing desires onto a particular product. This is the copy writer's task: not to create this mass desire -- but to channel and direct it." (~line 1168-1180)

**Agent instruction:** Never attempt to manufacture desire from nothing. Before writing any copy, identify the pre-existing desire in the market that the product can channel. If no mass desire exists, the copy will fail regardless of quality.

---

### P-02: The Amplification Effect
- **Type:** PRINCIPLE
- **Layer:** 0-foundational

> "By simply directing this gigantic, already-existing mass desire -- rather than being required to create it -- advertising thus commands an economic force hundreds of times more powerful than the mere number of dollars that the advertiser can spend on it. This is the Amplification Effect of successful advertising." (~line 1306-1318)

> "When it tries to create this desire, it is no longer advertising but education. And, as education, it can produce at best only one dollar in sales for every dollar spent on advertising." (~line 1322-1328)

**Agent instruction:** If the copy reads like it is teaching/educating rather than channeling existing desire, rewrite. Education = $1 return per $1 spent. Channeling = $50-$100 return per $1 spent.

---

### P-03: Mass Desire Definition
- **Type:** MECHANISM
- **Layer:** 1-theoretical

> "We can define this Mass Desire quite simply. It is the public spread of a private want." (~line 1250-1252)

> "It is the moment when a private desire is shared by a statistically significant number of people, large enough to profitably repay selling these people, that a market is born." (~line 1280-1286)

---

### P-04: The Three Dimensions of Mass Desire
- **Type:** MECHANISM
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

Every mass desire has three vital dimensions for evaluation:

1. **Urgency** -- "intensity, degree of demand to be satisfied. For example, constant arthritic pains compared to a minor headache." (~line 1472-1476)
2. **Staying power** -- "degree of repetition, the inability to become satiated. For example, raw hunger compared to a craving for gourmet foods." (~line 1478-1480)
3. **Scope** -- "the number of people who share this desire." (~line 1482-1490)

**Agent instruction:** When choosing which desire to lead with, score it on all three dimensions. Choose the desire that maximizes across all three, not just one.

---

### P-05: Two Products in Every Product
- **Type:** MECHANISM
- **Layer:** 1-theoretical

> "In reality, every product you are given to sell is actually two products. One of them is the physical product -- the steel, glass, paper or tobacco that the manufacturer has shaped into a particular pattern... The other is the functional product -- the product in action -- the series of benefits that your product performs for your consumer, and on the basis of which he buys your product." (~line 1576-1588)

> "The physical product does not sell." (~line 1590)

> "No physical part of your product can ever become a headline." (~line 1608)

---

### P-06: Five Uses of the Physical Product (Supporting Role Only)
- **Type:** MECHANISM
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

Physical product facts can only be used to support the functional promise:

1. **Justifying price** -- "the longer the car, the more tubes in the television set, the more stitches per inch in the suit, then the greater the number of dollars your product can command" (~line 1620-1628)
2. **Documenting quality of performance** -- "Tell your prospect the weight of steel in your car's door, and he's more likely to believe that your car will protect his life" (~line 1630-1648)
3. **Assuring continued performance over time** -- "Ceramic mufflers mean no repair bills for the life of your car" (~line 1650-1660)
4. **Sharpening the reader's mental picture** -- "every metal part of the chassis is shielded from every other metal part by a protective coat of rubber" (~line 1662-1672)
5. **Giving a fresh basis for believability** -- introducing "a new mechanism that performs the claim, or a new quality that assures its performance, or a new freedom from old limitations" (~line 1674-1694)

---

### P-07: The Headline's Sole Job
- **Type:** PRINCIPLE
- **Layer:** 0-foundational

> "Your headline has only one job -- to stop your prospect and compel him to read the second sentence of your ad. In exactly the same way, your second sentence has only one job -- to force him to read the third sentence of your ad." (~line 1950-1956)

> "Your headline does not need to sell at all. It does not have to mention your product. It does not even have to mention your main appeal." (~line 1937-1941)

---

### P-08: The Five Stages of Awareness (CORE TAXONOMY)
- **Type:** MECHANISM
- **Layer:** 1-theoretical

The market awareness scale, from easiest to most difficult:

**Stage 1 -- Most Aware:**
> "The customer knows of your product -- knows what it does -- knows he wants it. At this point, he just hasn't gotten around to buying it yet." (~line 2050-2053)

**Stage 2 -- Product-Aware (but doesn't yet want it):**
> "Your prospect isn't completely aware of all your product does, or isn't convinced of how well it does it, or hasn't yet been told how much better it does it now." (~line 2094-2098)

**Stage 3 -- Solution-Aware (knows desire, not your product):**
> "The prospect either knows, or recognizes immediately, that he wants what the product does; but he doesn't yet know that there is a product -- your product -- that will do it for him." (~line 2306-2310)

**Stage 4 -- Problem-Aware (has need, doesn't know solution):**
> "The prospect has -- not a desire -- but a need. He recognizes the need immediately. But he doesn't yet realize the connection between the fulfillment of that need and your product." (~line 2444-2448)

**Stage 5 -- Completely Unaware:**
> "The prospect is either not aware of his desire or his need -- or he won't honestly admit it to himself without being led into it by your ad -- or the need is so general and amorphous that it resists being summed up in a single headline -- or it's a secret that just can't be verbalized." (~line 2552-2560)

---

### P-09: Awareness Walls
- **Type:** PRINCIPLE
- **Layer:** 1-theoretical

> "Each of these stages is separated from the others by a psychological wall. On one side of that wall is indifference; on the other, intense interest." (~line 2573-2576)

> "A headline which will work to a market in one stage of awareness will not work to a market in another stage of awareness. Nor will it work, even to a market in which it has been successful, once that market passes on to a new stage of awareness." (~line 2600-2608)

---

### P-10: The Five Stages of Market Sophistication (CORE TAXONOMY)
- **Type:** MECHANISM
- **Layer:** 1-theoretical

**Stage 1 -- Virgin market (you are first):**
Be simple, be direct, name the desire or claim.

**Stage 2 -- Second in market:**
Copy the successful claim but enlarge on it. Drive it to the absolute limit. Outbid competition.

**Stage 3 -- Claims exhausted:**
Introduce a NEW MECHANISM -- a new way of making the old promise work.

**Stage 4 -- Mechanisms competing:**
Elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer.

**Stage 5 -- Market exhausted:**
Shift from promise and mechanism to IDENTIFICATION with the prospect himself. The market no longer believes advertising.

---

### P-11: Two Categories of Mass Desire Forces
- **Type:** MECHANISM
- **Layer:** 1-theoretical

**1. Permanent Forces:** (~line 1356-1386)
- Mass Instinct (women wanting to be attractive, men wanting virility, health)
- Mass technological problems (bad TV reception, corroding mufflers)
- These never fade; the copywriter's problem is differentiation

**2. Forces of Change:** (~line 1388-1448)
- Style/trends (beginning, fulfillment, reversal)
- Mass education (trickle-down tastes)
- Here the copywriter needs sensitivity, foresight, timing

---

### P-12: Prevention Headlines
- **Type:** PRINCIPLE
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

> "A man will not visualize future disasters occurring to himself, but he is perfectly capable of visualizing, and buying preventatives from, the image of such future problems affecting others around him." (~line 5356-5362)

Example: Decay-preventing toothpaste sold when ads focused decay on the children, not the parent. Life insurance sells by picturing horrors inflicted on wife and children. (~line 5346-5354)

---

### P-13: The Three Levels of Creativity
- **Type:** MECHANISM
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

**Level 1 -- Word-Substitute Technique (shallowest, most widespread, least effective):**
> "The copy writer consults a list of proven and successful headlines. He then pulls out the original product name and substitutes his own." (~line 4978-4984)
These become "Echo Ads -- ads that remind people of some other product." (~line 5018-5020)

**Level 2 -- Formulas:**
> "The copy writer has memorized a list of rules or principles, and tries to pour his headline into them like he'd pour hot lead into a mold." (~line 5032-5036)
Valid for verbalization, but insufficient for idea generation.

**Level 3 -- Analytical approach (deepest, only reliable method):**
> "No answers; only guide-posts and questions" (~line 5050-5054)
> "What you are looking for in this product and this market is the one element that makes them unique." (~line 5558-5560)

---

### P-14: Advertising Style Changes; Strategy Does Not
- **Type:** PRINCIPLE
- **Layer:** 1-theoretical

> "In effective advertising, though styles may change, strategy does not." (~line 3526-3527)

> "While the narrative style of both is now old-hat, you can still respond to their power. Both tap desires that still exist... And both evoke those desires, and channel those desires, so effectively, that if they were rewritten in today's idiom, and applied to different products, they still might sell millions of dollars worth of goods today." (~line 3530-3542)

---

## 2. DECISION RULES

### DR-01: Headline Content by Awareness Stage
- **Type:** DECISION_RULE
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

**IF Stage 1 (Most Aware)** --> THEN headline = product name + bargain price. "Your headline -- in fact, your entire ad -- need state little more except the name of your product and a bargain price." (~line 2054-2056)
Example: "Revere Zomar Lens, Electric Eye Camera -- Formerly $149.50 -- Now Only $119.95." (~line 2060-2062)

**IF Stage 2 (Product-Aware)** --> THEN "Display the name of the product -- either in the headline or in an equally large logo -- and use the remainder of the headline to point out its superiority." (~line 2147-2152)
Seven sub-tasks: (a) reinforce desire, (b) sharpen image, (c) extend image, (d) introduce new proof, (e) announce new mechanism, (f) announce elimination of former limitations, (g) completely change image/mechanism. (~line 2116-2144)

**IF Stage 3 (Solution-Aware)** --> THEN "Name the desire and/or its solution in your headline. Prove that that solution can be accomplished. And show that the mechanism of that accomplishment is contained in your product." (~line 2330-2336)

**IF Stage 4 (Problem-Aware)** --> THEN "Start by naming the need and/or its solution in your headline. Then dramatize the need so vividly that the prospect realizes just how badly he needs the solution. And then present your product as the inevitable solution." (~line 2460-2468)

**IF Stage 5 (Completely Unaware)** --> THEN "You are echoing an emotion, an attitude, a dissatisfaction that picks people out from the crowd and binds them together in a single statement." (~line 2730-2742) Use identification headline. Product comes much later in body copy.

---

### DR-02: Elimination Rules for Stage 5 Headlines
- **Type:** DECISION_RULE
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF market is completely unaware, THEN eliminate from the headline:

1. **Price** -- "Price means nothing to a person who does not know your product, or want your product." (~line 2664-2670)
2. **Product name** -- "The name of your product means nothing to a person who has never seen it before, and may actually damage your ad." (~line 2672-2684)
3. **Direct statement of function/desire** -- "A direct statement of what your product does, what desire it satisfies, or what problem it solves, simply will not work." (~line 2686-2704)

Result: "So you cannot mention price, product, function or desire. What do you have left? Your market, of course!" (~line 2706-2708)

---

### DR-03: Headline Strategy by Sophistication Stage
- **Type:** DECISION_RULE
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

**IF Stage 1 (First in market)** --> THEN "Be simple. Be direct. Above all, don't be fancy. Name either the need or the claim in your headline -- nothing more. Dramatize that claim in your copy -- make it as powerful as possible. And then bring in your product; and prove that it works." (~line 3676-3682)

**IF Stage 2 (Second in market, direct claim still working)** --> THEN "copy that successful claim -- but enlarge on it. Drive it to the absolute limit. Outbid your competition." (~line 3716-3720)

**IF Stage 3 (Claims exhausted)** --> THEN introduce "A NEW MECHANISM -- a new way to making the old promise work. A different process -- a fresh chance -- a brand-new possibility of success where only disappointment has resulted before." (~line 3896-3906)
The mechanism moves INTO the headline. The claim gets abbreviated to shorthand. (~line 3970-3984)

**IF Stage 4 (Mechanisms competing)** --> THEN "Simply elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer; allow it to solve more of the problem; overcome old limitations; promise extra benefits." (~line 4078-4084)

**IF Stage 5 (Market exhausted)** --> THEN "The emphasis shifts from the promise and the mechanism which accomplishes it, to identification with the prospect himself." (~line 4144-4148) Use identification strategy from Awareness Stage 5.

---

### DR-04: When to Shift from Claim to Mechanism in Headline
- **Type:** DECISION_RULE
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF the market has heard all the claims in all their extremes --> THEN "the emphasis shifts from what the product does to HOW it works. Not accomplishment, but performance becomes dominant." (~line 3908-3911)

**Structural reversal:** In Stage 2 ads, headline = full claim; subhead = abbreviated mechanism. In Stage 3 ads, headline = mechanism; subhead = full claim restated. (~line 3942-4004)

Example of the reversal:
- Stage 2: "I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER... NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE." (claim in headline, mechanism abbreviated below)
- Stage 3: "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!" (mechanism in headline, claim restated below: "melts up to 37 POUNDS off men and women -- without starvation diets")

---

### DR-05: One Performance Per Headline
- **Type:** DECISION_RULE
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

> "Every product gives you dozens of keys. But only one will fit the lock. Your job is to find that one dominant performance -- squeeze every drop of power out of it in your presentation -- and then convince your reader that that performance and that satisfaction can come only from your product." (~line 1818-1826)

> "Your headline is limited by physical space. You have only one glance of the reader's eye to stop him... the span of his attention will admit only one thought to penetrate his indifference during that glance." (~line 1802-1810)

IF the wrong performance is chosen --> THEN "nothing else that you do in the ad will matter." (~line 1510)

---

### DR-06: When to Use Splinter Market Strategy
- **Type:** DECISION_RULE
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

IF small company with limited budget competing against larger rivals --> THEN "concentrate its attack on a smaller segment of that market" based on "the sociology of the market rather than its geography." (~line 5402-5412)

IF splinter campaign succeeds --> THEN "the success of the initial limited campaign can be used as a point of difference to appeal to the larger market." (~line 5432-5440)

---

### DR-07: When Direct Appeal Fails
- **Type:** DECISION_RULE
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

> "Wherever the direct appeal fails, or loses its power, you should begin to explore a fifth stage headline." (~line 3428-3430)

---

### DR-08: Prevention Headlines Decision
- **Type:** DECISION_RULE
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

IF selling prevention --> THEN do NOT picture the disaster happening to the prospect himself. INSTEAD picture it happening to his loved ones (children, wife, friends).

## 3. FORMULAS & TEMPLATES

### F-01: The Three-Step Copywriting Process
- **Type:** FORMULA
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

1. "Choose the most powerful desire that can possibly be applied to your product." (~line 1468-1470)
2. "Acknowledge that desire -- reinforce it -- and/or offer the means to satisfy it -- in a single statement in the headline of your ad." (~line 1526-1530)
3. "Take the series of performances that are built into your product -- what your product does -- and you show your prospect how these product performances inevitably satisfy that desire." (~line 1558-1570)

---

### F-02: Three Questions Before Writing Any Headline
- **Type:** FORMULA
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

> 1. "What is the mass desire that creates this market?" (~line 1904)
> 2. "How much do these people know today about the way your product satisfies this desire? (Their State of Awareness.)" (~line 1908-1910)
> 3. "How many other products have been presented to them before yours? (Their State of Sophistication.)" (~line 1912-1914)

---

### F-03: Stage 3 Solution-Aware Headline Formula
- **Type:** FORMULA
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

Three steps:
1. Name the desire and/or its solution in the headline
2. Prove that solution can be accomplished
3. Show that the mechanism of accomplishment is contained in your product
(~line 2330-2336)

---

### F-04: Stage 4 Problem-Aware Headline Formula
- **Type:** FORMULA
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

Three steps:
1. Name the need and/or its solution in the headline
2. Dramatize the need so vividly the prospect realizes how badly he needs the solution
3. Present your product as the inevitable solution
(~line 2460-2468)

---

### F-05: Stage 5 Unaware Market -- Progressive Disclosure Formula
- **Type:** FORMULA
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

Structure of the body copy when using a Stage 5 identification headline:

> "These paragraphs are building a steady progression of logical images, from the first identification with the headline, to a growing awareness of the problem or the desire, to the realization that a solution is at hand, and to the inevitable focussing of that desire and that solution onto your particular product." (~line 2766-2776)

Sequence: Identification --> Growing awareness --> Solution realization --> Product focus

---

### F-06: Stage 2 Product-Aware -- Seven Headline Sub-Tasks
- **Type:** FORMULA
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

When the customer knows the product but doesn't yet want it, the headline must do one of seven things:

(a) Reinforce desire for product (via Association, Example, Sensory Sharpening, Illustration)
(b) Sharpen image of how product satisfies desire
(c) Extend image of where/when product satisfies desire
(d) Introduce new proof/details/documentation
(e) Announce new mechanism enabling better satisfaction
(f) Announce new mechanism eliminating former limitations
(g) Completely change image or mechanism to escape competition
(~line 2116-2144)

---

### F-08: Third-Stage Ad Structure (Mechanism-Led)
- **Type:** FORMULA
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

Structure:
- **Headline:** Mechanism (how it works)
- **Subhead / First paragraph:** Full claim restated
- **Body:** Documentation, proof, product details

Example:
> Headline: "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!"
> Lead: "Released for the first time! The amazing scientific discovery that melts up to 37 POUNDS off men and women -- without starvation diets, without a single hungry moment -- without even giving up the foods you love!" (~line 4006-4016)

---

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS & WARNINGS

### AP-01: Never Try to Create Desire
- **Type:** ANTI_PATTERN
- **Layer:** 0-foundational

> "It would be impossible for any one advertiser to spend enough money to actually create this mass desire. He can only exploit it. And he dies when he tries to run against it." (~line 1182-1186)

Examples of catastrophic failure:
- Chrysler (1948): bucked trend toward longer/lower cars. "Multimillion-dollar campaign... results were catastrophic." (~line 1194-1210)
- Ford (1954): tried to sell safety when market wanted horsepower. "Results were non-existent." (~line 1222-1230)
- Edsel: "died trying to fight the overwhelming switch in demand to a cheap, simple, inexpensive-to-run compact car." (~line 1232-1238)

---

### AP-02: Never Use a Wrong-Stage Headline
- **Type:** ANTI_PATTERN
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

> "A headline that will work wonders in the first stage -- for example, 'Dial Soap -- 90 cents a cake' -- will fail completely when addressed to a third-stage market where your prospect doesn't even realize that soaps can be made with built-in deodorants." (~line 2586-2592)

> "And a third-stage headline -- for example 'Who else wants a whiter wash with no hard work?' -- will be old-hat, no-news to today's housewife, who has been barraged by whiter-than-white advertising for twenty years." (~line 2592-2598)

---

### AP-03: Never Write an Empty Stage-5 Headline
- **Type:** ANTI_PATTERN
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

> "It cannot simply be a startler, or an attention-getter, or humorous, or cute. Nor can it mask the fact that it has no headline behind a pretty picture. Most copy writers use a fifth stage problem to write an empty headline, and are therefore simply wasting their client's money." (~line 3453-3462)

---

### AP-04: The Identification Requirement for Stage 5
- **Type:** ANTI_PATTERN
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

> "Your prospect must identify with your headline before he can buy from it. It must be his headline, his problem, his state of mind at that particular moment. It must pick out the product's logical prospects -- and reject as many people as it attracts." (~line 3466-3472)

### AP-05: Never Copy Yourself
- **Type:** ANTI_PATTERN
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

> "The more successful the copy writer, the greater the temptation to find his new headline in his old files. But it won't work. Copying can be done by any cub. All this process does is bring talent down to the level of file-cabinet mediocrity." (~line 5086-5096)

### AP-06: Echo Ads
- **Type:** ANTI_PATTERN
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

> "They become Echo Ads -- ads that remind people of some other product. They pay no attention to unique product-market-timing relationship that exists at the moment. Therefore they lose all the strengths that are wrapped up in that relationship." (~line 5018-5026)

### AP-07: The Disintegration of Over-Enlargement (Stage 2 Decay)
- **Type:** ANTI_PATTERN
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

> "Toward the end, the process disintegrates. The successful claim is overworked; enlargement piles on enlargement. New competitors enter the field -- each trying to promise more. Headlines double and triple in size. Words begin to lose their meaning -- 'whiter-than-whites' appear. The prospect becomes confused -- then skeptical. Believability is shattered; claims are automatically discounted 50% by their readers." (~line 3790-3804)

### AP-08: Putting the Full Selling Burden on the Headline
- **Type:** ANTI_PATTERN
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

> "To demand that a headline should do any of these [sell, mention product, mention main appeal] is to place the full selling burden on approximately 10% to 20% of the total physical space of your ad." (~line 1942-1948)

> "To attempt to do the same selling job in ten words, instead of a hundred, or a thousand, is to shoot craps with your client's money." (~line 1972-1975)

## 6. AGENT INSTRUCTIONS (Synthesis)

### AI-01: Pre-Writing Checklist (Before Writing Any Copy)
- **Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

Before writing a single word of copy, answer these questions in order:

**Step 1 -- Identify the Mass Desire:**
- What pre-existing desire does the target market already feel?
- Score it on: Urgency (1-10), Staying Power (1-10), Scope (how many people?)
- Is this a Permanent Force or a Force of Change?

**Step 2 -- Analyze the Product:**
- List every performance (functional benefit) the product delivers
- For each performance, map it to the mass desire it satisfies
- Select the ONE dominant performance that harnesses the greatest sales power right now

**Step 3 -- Determine State of Awareness:**
- Stage 1 (Most Aware): Knows product, knows it works, wants it, just hasn't bought
- Stage 2 (Product-Aware): Knows product exists, not fully convinced or updated
- Stage 3 (Solution-Aware): Knows what they want done, doesn't know this product does it
- Stage 4 (Problem-Aware): Has the need, doesn't know a solution exists
- Stage 5 (Completely Unaware): Doesn't recognize desire/need, or can't admit it

**Step 4 -- Determine State of Sophistication:**
- Stage 1: No one has sold this type of product to this market before
- Stage 2: A few competitors have made the direct claim
- Stage 3: The market has heard all the claims in all their extremes
- Stage 4: Mechanisms are now competing against each other
- Stage 5: The market no longer believes any advertising in this category

**Step 5 -- Derive Headline Strategy from the Awareness x Sophistication Matrix:**
Cross-reference the two stages to determine what goes in the headline:

| | Soph 1 | Soph 2 | Soph 3 | Soph 4 | Soph 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Aware 1** | Name + Price | Name + Better Price/Offer | N/A (rare) | N/A | N/A |
| **Aware 2** | Name + Claim | Name + Enlarged Claim | Name + Mechanism | Name + Better Mechanism | Identification |
| **Aware 3** | Desire/Solution | Enlarged Desire | Mechanism + Desire | Better Mechanism + Desire | Identification |
| **Aware 4** | Need/Solution | Dramatized Need | Mechanism + Need | Better Mechanism + Need | Identification |
| **Aware 5** | Identification | Identification | Identification | Identification | Identification |

### AI-02: Headline Writing Decision Tree
- **Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

```
START
  |
  v
Is the market Most Aware (Stage 1)?
  YES --> Write: [Product Name] + [Price/Offer]. Done.
  NO  --> Continue
  |
  v
Is the market Product-Aware (Stage 2)?
  YES --> Write: [Product Name in headline or logo] + [Superiority claim]
         Choose from 7 sub-tasks: reinforce, sharpen, extend, prove, new mechanism, remove limitation, change image
  NO  --> Continue
  |
  v
Is the market Solution-Aware (Stage 3)?
  YES --> Is sophistication Stage 1-2?
           YES --> Name the desire/solution directly. Be simple and direct.
           NO  --> Is sophistication Stage 3-4?
                    YES --> Lead with MECHANISM, abbreviate claim
                    NO  --> Use identification headline
  NO  --> Continue
  |
  v
Is the market Problem-Aware (Stage 4)?
  YES --> Name the need in headline. Dramatize in body. Present product as solution.
         Apply sophistication stage to determine if mechanism or identification is needed.
  NO  --> Continue
  |
  v
Market is Completely Unaware (Stage 5)
  --> Eliminate: price, product name, function, desire from headline
  --> Write identification headline that echoes emotion/attitude/dissatisfaction
  --> Build progressive disclosure in body: identification -> awareness -> solution -> product
```

### AI-03: Headline Verbalization Checklist
- **Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

After determining the headline CONTENT (what to say), run through these verbalization options to determine the best FORM (how to say it):

1. Can I quantify/measure the claim? (size, speed, count)
2. Can I compare it to something the reader already knows?
3. Can I use a vivid metaphor?
4. Can I make it sensory (taste, touch, smell, sight, sound)?
5. Can I demonstrate with a specific dramatic example?
6. Can I dramatize the result or use a before/after?
7. Can I state it as a paradox?
8. Can I remove a limitation ("without X")?
9. Can I attach authority or social proof?
10. Can I turn it into a question?
11. Can I offer information ("how to...")?
12. Can I turn it into a challenge?
13. Can I use a case-history quotation?
14. Can I condense it through substitution/symbolism?
15. Can I connect mechanism + claim in a single phrase?
16. Can I contradict expectations about how it works?
17. Can I stress newness or exclusivity?
18. Can I warn about pitfalls of NOT using it?
19. Can I use repetition/emphasis in phrasing?
20. Can I show how easy it is?
21. Can I address people who CAN'T buy it (reverse psychology)?
22. Can I address the prospect directly by identity?

Select the 2-3 strongest options and draft variants. Choose the one with maximum stopping power.

### AI-04: Quality Gate -- Headline Validation
- **Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION
- **Layer:** 3-tactical

Before finalizing any headline, verify:

- [ ] Does it match the market's current State of Awareness? (Not too advanced, not too basic)
- [ ] Does it match the market's current State of Sophistication? (Not repeating exhausted claims)
- [ ] Does it channel an EXISTING mass desire (not trying to create one)?
- [ ] Does it focus on ONE dominant performance/desire? (Not trying to say everything)
- [ ] Does it compel the reader to read the second sentence? (Not trying to sell in the headline)
- [ ] If Stage 5: Does it IDENTIFY with the market? (Not just clever/cute/startling)
- [ ] If Stage 5: Does it reject non-prospects as much as it attracts prospects?
- [ ] Is it about the FUNCTIONAL product (what it does), not the physical product (what it is)?
- [ ] Have I checked that this exact approach hasn't been exhausted by competitors?

### AI-05: Product Analysis Worksheet
- **Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

For every product, before writing, create this analysis:

**Physical Product:**
- Materials, features, specifications, construction
- USE ONLY FOR: price justification, quality documentation, longevity assurance, mental picture sharpening, believability basis

**Functional Product (what sells):**
- Performance 1: [what it does] --> satisfies [which mass desire]
- Performance 2: [what it does] --> satisfies [which mass desire]
- Performance 3: [what it does] --> satisfies [which mass desire]
- ...

**Dominant Performance Selection:**
- Which performance taps the desire with highest Urgency x Staying Power x Scope?
- Is this the right performance for THIS moment in the market's evolution?
- Has this performance been claimed by competitors? If yes, what sophistication stage?

### AI-06: Sophistication Escalation Playbook
- **Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

When the current sophistication stage stops working:

**Stage 1 --> Stage 2 transition:**
Take the working claim and ENLARGE it. Make it bigger, faster, more dramatic. Push to outer limits of believability.

**Stage 2 --> Stage 3 transition:**
STOP enlarging the claim. Instead, introduce a new MECHANISM -- a new way the promise is delivered. Move the mechanism INTO the headline. Abbreviate the claim to shorthand.

**Stage 3 --> Stage 4 transition:**
Take the working mechanism and ELABORATE on it. Make it easier, quicker, surer. Add benefits. Remove limitations.

**Stage 4 --> Stage 5 transition:**
STOP talking about mechanisms and promises. Shift entirely to IDENTIFICATION with the prospect. Use the prospect's state of mind, emotions, and self-image as the entry point. The product appears only deep in the body copy.

**Stage 5 --> Market restart:**
Look for a new performance dimension of the product, a new sub-market, or a new medium that lets you start the cycle again at Stage 1.

### AI-07: Splinter Market Strategy
- **Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

When facing dominant competitors in a broad market:

1. Identify sub-segments within the market that have distinct motivations (e.g., appearance vs. health in the reducing market)
2. Choose a segment that competitors are NOT specifically targeting
3. Craft headline, mechanism, and proof specifically for that segment
4. Select media channels specific to that segment
5. If successful, use the segment success as a point-of-difference credential when expanding to the broader market

---

### AI-08: Body Copy Length Decision
- **Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION
- **Layer:** 2-strategic

The ad must be long enough to accomplish three things:

1. Build desire for the product to its greatest possible strength
2. Make the prospect feel comfortable and complimented by the product (identification -- seeing it as part of his life)
3. Compensate for pre-existing prejudices and disbelief (belief/proof)

The more unaware or sophisticated the market, the longer the copy must be. Stage 5 awareness or Stage 5 sophistication markets require the longest, most carefully graduated copy to walk the prospect from identification through to product.

### AI-09: Cardinal Rule of Creativity
- **Type:** AGENT_INSTRUCTION
- **Layer:** 0-foundational

> "What you are looking for in this product and this market is the one element that makes them unique. The idea you want -- the headline you want -- the breakthrough you want -- are all wrapped up inside that product and that market. Nowhere else. And no outside rule -- no outside formula will give them to you. You are facing a product-market-timing relationship that never happened before -- it is unique. And the solution you need is just as unique." (~line 5558-5572)

**Agent instruction:** After using all frameworks and checklists above, the final headline must still emerge from the SPECIFIC product-market-timing intersection. Frameworks narrow the search space; they do not produce the answer. The answer comes from deep immersion in the product and market.
