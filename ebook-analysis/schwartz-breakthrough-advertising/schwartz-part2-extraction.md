## 1. THE THREE DIMENSIONS OF PROSPECT'S MIND

**Source:** Chapter 6 — "Inside Your Prospect's Mind" (~lines 5675-5965)

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 0

**The Three Dimensions that determine all copy:**

> "Your copy must be long enough to accomplish this change—and the length of your ad will depend on three factors: First, how much copy you need to build his desire for that product—and everything that product can do for him—to its greatest possible strength. Second, how much additional copy you need to make him feel both comfortable and complimented by that product, to enable him to visualize that product as a part of the life structure that he has built, and is building, for himself. And, finally, how much additional copy you need to make him believe what you have said—to compensate for his already-existing prejudices and beliefs." — Ch. 6, ~line 5729

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

The three dimensions:
1. **Desires** — wants, needs, cravings that drive the prospect. Physical, material, sensual.
2. **Identifications** — roles the prospect wants to play; personality traits he wants to project.
3. **Beliefs** — opinions, attitudes, prejudices, fragments of knowledge the prospect lives by.

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 1

**IF** your product satisfies a physical want → **THEN** lead with Intensification (desire-building).
**IF** your product defines a role or projects personality → **THEN** lead with Identification copy.
**IF** your prospect has established beliefs that block the sale → **THEN** lead with Gradualization (belief-building).

**Source:** Ch. 6, ~lines 5777-5963

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 0

> "You cannot create them, diminish them, or battle them. But you can expand them, sharpen them, channel them, and give them a goal. And this is your primary task as a copy writer." — Ch. 6, ~line 5805 (on Desires)

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 0

> "Advertising, like science, must accept reality as it exists, not as it might wish it to exist. Only then can it alter reality—not by smashing into it head-on—but by exploiting its tendencies and giving direction to its energies." — Ch. 6, ~line 5907

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 1

> "You start with these beliefs as a base. You build up from them by using his kind of logic, not your own, to prove that your product satisfies his desires." — Ch. 6, ~line 5927

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

---

## 2. TECHNIQUE 1: INTENSIFICATION

**Source:** Chapter 7 — "Thirteen Ways to Strengthen Desire" (~lines 5969-8299)

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 0

> "The force that creates sales, that powers our present economy, is desire. Mass Desire, spread among millions of men and women. And the art of salesmanship, fundamentally and primarily, is expanding this desire." — Ch. 7, ~line 5979

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 1

> "Your job is to fill out these vague desires with concrete images—to show your prospect every possible way that they can be fulfilled—to multiply their strength by the number of satisfactions that you can suggest to achieve them." — Ch. 7, ~line 6019

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 1

> "A copy writer's first qualifications are imagination and enthusiasm. You are literally the script writer for your prospect's dreams. You are the chronicler of his future. Your job is to show him in minute detail all the tomorrows that your product makes possible for him." — Ch. 7, ~line 6027

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 2

> "No matter what you do, your prospect will take with him only one basic idea, one dominant image from your ad. But with every additional new and different way that you can present that idea, it becomes sharper and more real in your prospect's mind, and it builds up more and more emotional weight." — Ch. 7, ~line 6109

**IF** you have presented the core benefit once → **THEN** present the SAME benefit from a different perspective, not a different benefit. Each variation sharpens the same dominant image.

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### ANTI_PATTERN | Layer 2

> "You cannot repeat, but you can reinforce. And every time the same basic promise is given a fresh setting for your prospect, it reinforces the descriptions that went before it, and makes your prospect that much more determined to participate." — Ch. 7, ~line 6151

**IF** you repeat the exact same phrasing → **THEN** you lose the reader. Instead, present the same promise in a new context.

**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### FORMULA: The Thirteen Intensification Techniques | Layer 3

1. **Direct Description** — Present the product or its satisfaction directly, bluntly, with thorough detail of appearance or results. (~line 6201)

2. **Product-in-Action** — Show not only how the product looks and what benefits it gives, but exactly HOW it does this. Put the product in motion. (~line 6447)

3. **Bring In the Reader** — Put your reader right in the middle of the product-in-action story. Give him a verbal demonstration of what will happen the first day he owns the product. (~line 6587)

4. **Demonstration-Test** — Turn the demonstration into a test. Let the reader visualize himself PROVING the performance. (~line 6655)

5. **Stretch Benefits in Time** — Show the product at work not for just an hour or a day, but over a span of weeks and months. Extend the reader's vision further and further into time. (~line 6789)

6. **Bring In an Audience** — Other actors besides the reader are brought into the scene. Celebrities through testimonial; average people through case history; each provides fresh perspective. (~line 6893)

7. **Show Experts Approving** — Experts, professionals, the discriminating, the blase register their reactions. "There is nothing so astounding as the astonishment of experts." (~line 6995)

8. **Compare, Contrast, Prove Superiority** — Lay disadvantages of the old product side by side with advantages of the new, throwing advantages into sharp relief. (~line 7069)

9. **Picture the Black Side (Heaven-or-Hell)** — Paint the negative aspect in full black color. Irritate the wound, then apply the salve. Derive two currents of motivation: repulsion from the problem + attraction to the solution. (~line 7147)

10. **Show How Easy It Is** — At every point the product touches the prospect's life—price, ease of use, durability, portability—furnish another fresh perspective to reiterate benefits. (~line 7289)

11. **Use Metaphor, Analogy, Imagination** — Present facts in more dramatic form outside the rigidly realistic approach. Personify the product; use extended analogies. (~line 7341)

12. **Catalog Summary** — Brief condensed listing of all performances, benefits, and/or applications without description or elaboration. Two types: (a) horizontal—expanding among ever-enlarging groups of applications; (b) vertical—deepening desire by piling desire upon desire. (~line 7417)

13. **Guarantee as Climax** — Turn the guarantee into the climax of the ad—the last brief summary of performances, reinforced at every step by the positive reassertion of that guarantee. (~line 7735)

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 3

> "As long as each additional fresh perspective continues to build the dominant desire in your prospect's mind, use it. But if the additional perspective is not different or dramatic enough to renew your prospect's interest in your claims, then leave it out." — Ch. 7, ~line 7431

**IF** new perspective builds the dominant desire → **THEN** include it.
**IF** new perspective does not renew interest → **THEN** leave it out.

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 3

> "Perhaps the best way to measure the balance between the two—that critical turning point where reinforcement becomes mere repetition—is to re-read your ad, some days after you have first written it." — Ch. 7, ~line 7451

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### FORMULA: Campaign Construction | Layer 2

> "Thus you have your Central Campaign Idea, and its continuous restatement in a series of fresh disguises." — Ch. 7, ~line 7991

**Two creative problems for campaigns:**
1. **Compress** the dominant image into a single statement or picture so powerful it sells the first time AND continues selling when used repeatedly.
2. **Present a series of variations** of that central image—each emerging from the dominant idea, but each so different that they impel the prospect to read, and so fresh they make the dominant idea seem new again.

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### EXAMPLE: Campaign Variation Strategies | Layer 4

**Strategy 1 — Ritualistic Repetition + Varied Opening:**
Colgate Gardol campaign: "Gardol—the Invisible Shield that Protects Your Teeth." Identical verbal message each time; variations only in opening 10-second demonstration. (~line 8011)

**Strategy 2 — Rule and Example:**
Toni: "WHICH TWIN HAS THE TONI—and which has the $15 permanent?" Unvarying headline + continuously changing stream of illustrative photographs. (~line 8067)

Clairol: "DOES SHE OR DOESN'T SHE? Hair-coloring so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure." Same headline + changing illustrations of women in everyday activities. (~line 8091)

**Strategy 3 — Product as Focal Point (Building-Block Ads):**
Volkswagen: No repeated slogan at all. Rigid focus on the car with completely different copy messages per ad. Each ad reveals another fact. Together, the series builds overwhelming impression. (~line 8155)

**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 2

> "The copy writer is taking the position that he can only sell adequately with the number of words allowed him by the body copy. Therefore he is willing to risk his headline in grasping the attention of his prospect and impelling him to read on, into the sales message itself. If he fails in his gamble, he has wasted his page. If he succeeds, he has doubled and tripled the effectiveness of his ad." — Ch. 7, ~line 8281 (The Creative Gamble)

**IF** you need a full body copy sell and your headline cannot contain the complete selling message → **THEN** use the headline to grasp attention and drive into body copy, even at the risk of not naming the product in the headline.

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

---

## 3. TECHNIQUE 2: IDENTIFICATION

**Source:** Chapter 8 — "How to Build a Saleable Personality Into Your Product" (~lines 8300-9823)

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 1

> "Every product you work on should offer your prospect two separate and distinct reasons for buying it. First, it should offer him the fulfillment of a physical want or need. This is the satisfaction your product gives him. And second, it should offer him a particular method of fulfilling that need, that defines him to the outside world as a particular kind of human being." — Ch. 8, ~line 8461

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### MECHANISM | Layer 1

**Two types of identification roles:**

**1. Character Roles** — Usually expressed by adjectives ("progressive," "chic," "brilliant," "well-read"). They belong to the prospect's personality. They are partly unconscious, never openly claimed, subject to fantasy. (~line 8535)

> "Your prospect is far more ready to believe in the character roles you assign to him, than he is to believe in either your product's performance claims, or the achievement roles it may offer him." — Ch. 8, ~line 8669

**2. Achievement Roles** — Status roles, class roles, position roles created by society. Usually expressed by nouns/titles ("Executive," "Home Owner," "$20,000-a-year-Man," "Career Woman," "Good Mother"). (~line 8717)

> "The easiest and most universally acknowledged symbols of success in America today are the products we can buy. Products that are purchased—not by any stretch of the imagination for their physical function alone—but for the definition they give us as their possessors." — Ch. 8, ~line 8759

**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 2

**IF** your product does the same job as competitors AND price is not a factor → **THEN** the prospect's choice will depend on the difference in ROLE your product offers. Build identification into your copy.

**Source:** Ch. 8, ~line 8855

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### FORMULA: Building Product Identification | Layer 3

**Step 1:** Identify the **primary image** the product already has in the prospect's mind.

**Step 2:** Use the primary image as raw material to construct new, double, triple images that draw in more of the most-wanted roles.

Two methods:
- **Change intensity of primary image** — Emphasize/dramatize if already acceptable; tone down if negative/neutral.
- **Use primary image as bridge** — Weave favorable social and character images into the product personality, always emerging from the primary image.

> "If you demand that your prospect jump across a believability-chasm, your ad will fail. If, however, you build a bridge of ideas or images across that chasm—starting on his side—then he will let you lead him almost anywhere." — Ch. 8, ~line 9641

**Source:** Ch. 8, ~lines 9035-9647

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### ANTI_PATTERN | Layer 2

> "Many campaigns have collapsed because they have asked their market to identify themselves with an unbelievable image." — Ch. 8, ~line 9553

**IF** the identification image is too far from the prospect's reality → **THEN** disbelief spreads to the performance claims themselves, and kills the sale.

**Example:** The deodorant-soap campaign that used elite society imagery to sell mass market. "The men and women who composed the market could not make the jump between themselves and the characters pictured in the ad." (~line 9557)

**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### ANTI_PATTERN | Layer 2

> "You cannot contradict accepted images or beliefs in advertising. This is not advertising's role." — Ch. 8, ~line 9187

**IF** you try to discard a product's primary images and substitute contradictory ones → **THEN** the ad will fail. People won't believe a product is what it isn't.

**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 3

**Two-question believability test for identification images:**

1. Do people already believe the product has the character traits you claim? AND can they identify their lives/position with these traits?
   - **IF** YES to both → use the image as conceived.
   - **IF** NO to either → proceed to step 2.

2. What primary image can serve as a believability-bridge between what the prospect already believes and what you want him to believe?

**Source:** Ch. 8, ~lines 9580-9647

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### EXAMPLE: Marlboro Triple Identification | Layer 4

Marlboro intensified the primary virility image three ways:
1. Presented men who were, in themselves, virile
2. Presented these men in situations/occupations that demand virility
3. Affixed one of the most primitive symbols of virility—the tattoo

> "A single dominant emotion—virility—symbolized three ways. The impact of repetition reinforced through variation." — Ch. 8, ~line 9131

**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific

---

## 4. TECHNIQUE 3: GRADUALIZATION

**Source:** Chapter 9 — "How to Make Your Prospect Believe Your Claims Before You State Them" (~lines 9829-11427)

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 0

> "If you violate your prospect's established beliefs in the slightest degree—either in content or direction—then nothing you promise him, no matter how appealing, can save your ad." — Ch. 9, ~line 9987

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 0

> "If you can channel the tremendous force of his belief—either in content or direction—behind only one claim, no matter how small, then that one fully-believed claim will sell more goods than all the half-questioned promises your competitors can write for all the rest of their days." — Ch. 9, ~line 9995

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 0-foundational

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 1

> "One fully-believed promise has ten times the sales power of ten partially-believed promises. Most copy writers try to strengthen ads by piling promise upon promise. What they usually get for their troubles is greater sales resistance." — Ch. 9, ~line 10964

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### MECHANISM | Layer 1

**The Architecture of Belief:**

Every claim has two separate sources of strength:
1. The content of the statement itself
2. The preparation made for that statement (either existing in the prospect's mind, or deliberately laid in preceding copy)

> "Effective advertising, like effective literature, is built—not of words—but of reactions. We put down on paper an architecture of words. If these words are effective, they evoke, in turn, an architecture of reactions in our prospect's mind. We are creating a stream of acceptances." — Ch. 9, ~line 10153

**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### FORMULA: Gradualization Devices | Layer 3

**Device 1: The Inclusion Question**

Ask a question that seems to limit the market but actually assures a YES answer from the overwhelming majority.

> "Was your set purchased after the spring of 1947?" — 95% would answer Yes. Thus the ad has built two acceptances in its first two sentences. (~line 10405)

Purpose: Permit immediate identification with your story, build a Habit of Agreement.

**Device 2: Detailed Identification**

Instead of asking questions, detail symptoms or problems that are the prospect's reasons for desiring your product. The reader knows you are talking about HIM.

> "Let me explain. I don't care whether your child is six years old or twenty—boy or girl—in grade school, high school or college. It makes no difference how badly that child is doing in school today—how difficult it is for him to concentrate..." — (~line 11062)

**Device 3: Contradiction of Present (False) Beliefs**

Come bluntly out and say "I know you think this is true; but I'm going to show you it's false." Best used with strong authority.

> "From this moment on, forget everything you have ever heard or read about what age 'must do' to your appearance." — (~line 11112)

**Device 4: The Language of Logic**

Interlace each new promise with language-signals that show it logically follows from everything proved before. The vocabulary of logic: "therefore," "here's why," "the reason for this is clear," "it has been proved by thousands," "sound impossible? Not at all."

> "These words have been used for centuries in court, in politics, in science—even in detective stories—to show others that proof has been offered, that reason has been used, that one statement logically and inevitably follows from another. Therefore, after centuries of conditioning, the words themselves—regardless of the content of the statements to which they are attached—now carry conviction." — Ch. 9, ~line 11190

**Specific logic phrases to use:**
- "This has been proved by thousands..."
- "Sound impossible? Not at all. It's actually as simple..."
- "Here's why..."
- "And, most important of all, is the fact that..."
- "Therefore..."
- "This was, without a doubt, the most thorough..."
- "They discovered—in case after case—that..."

**Device 5: Syllogistic Thinking**

Build formal logical structures where one statement inevitably leads into another. Create a feeling of inevitability.

> "Your car runs because gasoline is fed into the cylinders where a spark causes it to fire... Now here is the important thing to you. The larger the spark is, the more powerful the explosion. The more powerful the explosion, the more power you get from your gasoline." — (~line 11314)

**Device 6: Other Belief Forms**

- **Contingency Structures** — "If... then...", "Was your... then..."
- **Repetition of Proof: Echoing** — "These experts found... These experts found... These experts found..."
- **Promise—Belief—Promise Variation** — Every sentence of promise is followed with proof, so the reader never has breathing space to question.
- **Paragraph Parallelism** — The same word structure used in an accepted statement is picked up exactly and used to borrow acceptance for a fresh claim.

**Source:** Ch. 9, ~lines 10996-11420

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 2

> "This fact—that your most powerful claim does not always make your most powerful headline—is a paradox that many copy writers still cannot accept." — Ch. 9, ~line 10245

**IF** a power-claim headline doesn't work (due to Awareness or Sophistication) → **THEN** split-test against a second headline with far fewer claims but far more likely to be believed. Build a belief-bridge from that second headline to the same claims.

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### EXAMPLE: TV Repair Manual Ad — Complete Gradualization Architecture | Layer 4

The step-by-step structure that built belief:

1. **Headline:** "WHY HAVEN'T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS?" — No claim, no promise, just implication of foul play matching existing suspicion. (First acceptance.)
2. **Inclusion question:** "Was your set purchased after the spring of 1947?" — 95% answer Yes. (Second acceptance.)
3. **First promise:** "Then here is the full, uncensored story of how you can avoid those $15-$20 repair bills..." — The word "Then" implies exclusion, adding credence. The mechanism is deliberately left ambiguous.
4. **Symptom questions:** "How many times this week have you had to get up to fix a jumpy TV picture?..." — Stream of Yes answers builds Habit of Agreement.
5. **First goal-conclusion:** "90% Of These Breakdowns Are Unnecessary!" — Supported by manufacturer's test rooms description.
6. **Expert authority:** "What TV Experts Have Learned About Your Set!" — Repeating the now-accepted condition: "If your set were properly cared for, as these sets were..."
7. **Second goal-conclusion (disguised):** "And, most important, these experts have discovered that you do not have to be a handyman..." — Entirely new assumption presented as mere continuation of series.
8. **Redefinition:** "Repairs" become "adjustments"; troubles become "warning signals" and "symptoms."
9. **Syllogistic close:** "It's as simple as that. You pay a repairman—not for his work—but for his knowledge."

**Key structural devices used:**
- Paragraph parallelism to disguise transitions
- "And" + "most important" as tie-in phrases
- Echo phrases ("These experts have discovered...")
- Symptom catalog for stream of acceptances

## 5. TECHNIQUE 4: REDEFINITION

**Source:** Chapter 10 — "How to Remove Objections to Your Product" (~lines 11432-12267)

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 1

> "Redefinition is the process of giving a new definition to your product. It says that the product is this rather than that. Its objective is to remove a roadblock to your sale—if possible, before the prospect even knows it exists." — Ch. 10, ~line 11498

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### FORMULA: Three Types of Redefinition | Layer 2

**Type 1: Simplification** — When the product sounds too hard to use.

**IF** product is (or sounds) too complicated → **THEN** redefine the complexity away before introducing the product.

**Key rule:** "Innovation without acceptance is valueless. The more people know that something is difficult, and the more revolutionary your product is—the more resistance you will meet from them in accepting it. You must, therefore, lay a base for acceptance by redefining the entire field for them, before you bring in your product." (~line 11840)

**Do NOT** just scream "EASY" in the ads. Instead:
1. Redefine (this chapter)
2. Mechanize the new simplicity (next chapter)

**Type 2: Escalation** — When the product's appeal isn't broad enough.

**IF** product does not have appeal broad enough for a mass market → **THEN** escalate the product. Broaden the horizon of benefits. Redefine the role the product plays in the prospect's life.

Three escalation strategies:
- **Increase benefit appeal** — Shift benefits from a less desirable area to one that generates more sales appeal.
- **Increase importance** — Show that something the prospect wants very much hinges directly on the performance of your product.
- **Increase frequency** — Show the product will be needed/used almost every waking minute.

> "Your Entire Life is Spent Trying to Get Others to Do What You Want—Without Friction." — (~line 12088)

**Type 3: Price Reduction** — When the product costs too much.

**IF** product price is too high compared to competitors → **THEN** switch the comparison to a more expensive standard.

> "Why does the product cost too much? Because it's being compared with other products in the same field. And how do you whittle away, psychologically, at this price? By switching the comparison, and relating it to some other, more expensive standard." — Ch. 10, ~line 12112

**Source:** Ch. 10, ~lines 11464-12262

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### EXAMPLE: Lifebuoy Soap — Flip-Flop Redefinition | Layer 4

The horrible medicinal odor was redefined from liability to asset. The B.O. campaign focused attention on the prospect's OWN body odor, then positioned the strong medicinal smell as overwhelming proof of odor-destroying power.

> "A simple concept-judo. A complete reversal. Turning a liability into an asset, with a single idea." — Ch. 10, ~line 11543

**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific

### EXAMPLE: Price Reduction via Psychological Redefinition | Layer 4

Spark plugs selling at $1.49 (1.5x standard) used TEN bargain-phrases in two paragraphs:
1. "practically made by hand..."
2. "would have to sell for as high as $5 each..."
3. "30 or 40 dollars..." (repeats hand-made price for full set)
4. "get the price down so low..."
5. "pay for themselves 12 times in one year..."
6. "astonishing proposition..."
7. "If you will check your car's performance..." (condition = favor)
8. "prepared to do..." (connotation of favor)
9. "You can have..." (not "you can buy")
10. "only $1.49 each..."

## 6. TECHNIQUE 5: MECHANIZATION

**Source:** Chapter 11 — "How to Verbally Prove That Your Product Does What You Claim" (~lines 12272-12847)

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 1

> "Actually, when your prospect reads your copy, he is engaging in a silent dialogue with you. You are feeding him ideas and images and emotions, in a planned pattern; and he is feeding back to you reactions to these ideas and images and emotions." — Ch. 11, ~line 12300

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### MECHANISM | Layer 1

**The three demands a prospect makes on your copy:**
1. **"Tell me more"** — Demands for more information, more image, more desire.
2. **"Oh yeah? Who says so?"** — Demands for proof.
3. **"How does it work?"** — Demands for a mechanism.

**Source:** Ch. 11, ~lines 12336-12354

**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### FORMULA: Three Stages of Mechanization | Layer 2

**Stage 1: Name the Mechanism**

**IF** prospect is already familiar with how the product works (from competitors' ads) → **THEN** simply name the mechanism and compete on price or other features.

> "TAKE FOOLPROOF PHOTOS WITH THE XENOPHON 1750. With Electronic Light Setter... Push-Button Zomar Lens... Magazine Load... Only $135." — (~line 12466)

**Stage 2: Describe the Mechanism**

**IF** prospect doesn't understand the mechanism, OR the mechanism is new → **THEN** describe how it works in selling language.

> "The first rule of mechanism copy is that it is not scientific discourse. You must never allow it to become dull, or merely factual. You must load it with promise, load it with emotion. Every word in good copy—including mechanism copy—sells." — Ch. 11, ~line 12611

**Stage 3: Feature the Mechanism in the Headline**

**IF** you have an exceptionally strong/dramatic mechanism, OR market is highly sophisticated with similar promises → **THEN** put the mechanism in the headline. The mechanism BECOMES the main claim.

Examples of mechanism headlines:
- "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY."
- "FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING."
- "RUN YOUR CAR WITHOUT SPARK PLUGS."
- "SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY."
- "TOMMY ARMOUR SAYS SMACK HELL OUT OF THE BALL WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND."

> "Every one of them offers you a new way to get what you've been wanting. A NEW WAY: a new mechanism; a new chance to satisfy your desire—even if everything else you've tried has failed you." — Ch. 11, ~line 12682

**Source:** Ch. 11, ~lines 12446-12718

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 2

**IF** people assume they know how your product works → **THEN** all the mechanism you need is a word or phrase.
**IF** people are not quite sure how it works → **THEN** describe the mechanism in selling language until they have enough reason-why.
**IF** you have an exceptionally strong mechanism OR you want to establish definite superiority → **THEN** sell the mechanism hard; feature it in the headline.

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 3

> "Price cuts must be justified. There must be a reason for them. A mechanism behind them. Without such a mechanism—without such a reason-why you should give this bargain—you are going to get only a fraction of its real sales power." — Ch. 11, ~line 12754

**IF** you are advertising a price reduction → **THEN** always provide a mechanism explaining WHY the price is reduced.

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### EXAMPLE: Robert Collier Price-Cut Mechanism | Layer 4

> "A short time ago one of the old, reliable mills that makes the finer qualities of woven Madras for shirts began sending out S.O.S. calls. They had kept their plant going steadily for months, thinking that the usual demand would easily take care of their excess output. But, with the weather so generally unseasonable, the usual demand didn't materialize. And there they were, heavily overstocked—and needing money." — (~line 12776)

The copy starts with the mechanism (6 paragraphs of WHY) and only goes into the bargain claims after. Result: ten times the believability for every word about bargain-value.

## 7. TECHNIQUE 6: CONCENTRATION

**Source:** Chapter 12 — "How to Destroy Alternate Ways for Your Prospect to Satisfy His Desire" (~lines 12852-13557)

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 1

> "No successful copy ever sells a product. It sells a way of satisfying a particular desire." — Ch. 12, ~line 12865

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### MECHANISM | Layer 1

**Five weapons to beat competition:**
1. **Superiority of product** — The ultimate weapon. (~line 12900)
2. **Superiority of promise** — Stronger, wider, more believable. (~line 12924)
3. **Product-role** — The personality, identification, prestige. (~line 12936)
4. **Response and reaction** — Ability to escalate claims, shift mechanisms, invade new markets. (~line 12944)
5. **Direct attack** — Concentration. (~line 12950)

**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 2

**WHEN to use Concentration (direct attack):**

**IF** you dominate a field, OR your story is so powerful/different → **THEN** do NOT attack. Don't give the competitor the prestige of attack.

**IF** your ad budget is much less than theirs, OR most prospects are already their customers → **THEN** your first problem is to crack their image, shatter loyalty, before rechanneling desire to you. Use Concentration.

**Source:** Ch. 12, ~lines 12966-12994

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### ANTI_PATTERN | Layer 2

> "Never attack a weakness unless you can provide the solution to that weakness at the same time!" — Ch. 12, ~line 13008

**IF** you attack another product only for your own good (to disparage the competitor) → **THEN** you will evoke skepticism and dislike.

**IF** you show the attack is for the customer's own good, because your product eliminates the weakness → **THEN** you have a sales story he will accept.

**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### FORMULA: Two Concentration Structures | Layer 3

**Structure 1: Interweaving Contrast (Point-by-Point)**

Bad-good-bad-good-bad-good. A weakness in the competing product is pointed out, then immediately counteracted by the benefit yours gives.

> "Let me point out again the general structure of this sequence. It is: Bad. Good. Bad. Good. Bad. Good. And so on. It thus offers repeated, direct, one-for-one contrast." — Ch. 12, ~line 13254

Additional techniques within this structure:
- Repeat words to contrast weakness vs. strength ("A spark plug jumps a spark" vs. "A fire injector fires on...")
- Use word-level contrast ("thin skimpy spark" vs. "heavy powerful flame")
- Include documentary mechanism for each benefit
- Redefinition within comparison

**Structure 2: Time-Sequence (Before/After)**

What happens to you now (with old product) → What will happen when you switch (to new product).

Structure:
1. Define old methods as passive/inadequate
2. Show cause-and-effect of using old methods (narrate the failure experience)
3. Climax with inevitable failure of old approach
4. Transition to hero-product (foreshadowed by negative accusations)
5. Return to Intensification copy with strong picture-image sell

**Source:** Ch. 12, ~lines 13066-13512

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 3

> "It is not the content, nor is it the length of copy used in a mechanism that makes it effective. It is simply and solely the problem it solves for you in the development of your copy—by the emotional reaction it produces on your reader when he encounters it." — Ch. 12, ~line 13540

Concentration can be boiled down to a single phrase: "SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY." — Contrast, implied weakness in others, compensating promise in yours. All in five words.

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

## 8. TECHNIQUE 7: CAMOUFLAGE

**Source:** Chapter 13 — "How to Borrow Conviction for Your Copy" (~lines 13562-14101)

### MECHANISM | Layer 1

> "A conditioned reflex has been formed here. The man believes in the publication. The publication phrases its material in a certain way. After a while, that phraseology begins to carry an aura of truth all by itself, no matter what material it embraces." — Ch. 13, ~line 13646

**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### FORMULA: Three Ways to Borrow Believability | Layer 3

**Method 1: Adopt the Format**

Merge your copy with the publication's look. Allow the reader to enter your ad with the least possible mental shifting of gears from "editorial" to "advertisement."

> "A single change in format can add 50% to your readership, and your results." — Ch. 13, ~line 13694

Specific adaptations:
- Use publication's headline type
- Use publication's sub-headline treatment
- Use publication's illustration style (line drawings if they use line drawings)
- Use publication's column layout and sub-head placement
- Match typographic details (bars, rules, spacing)

**Method 2: Adopt the Phraseology**

Borrow stereotyped phrases that carry an aura of truth. For newspapers: issue date, city of origin, by-line, news-style opening.

> "SKIN SPECIALIST DEMONSTRATES HOW TO RINSE AWAY YOUR BLACKHEADS. By Claire Hoffman. New York, N.Y.—A leading doctor today showed an audience of men, women and skin-troubled teenagers how to..." — (~line 13858)

For direct mail: mimic the format of refund checks, government correspondence, dividend notices, confidential reports.

For radio/TV: adopt the news format, the clipped phrase of the newscaster, the insider tone of the analyst.

> "Study the channels of communication that people believe in. Adopt their tone, their feel, their style, their sincerity. Make your ads blend in, so there is no jarring transition. Camouflage them." — Ch. 13, ~line 13900

**Method 3: Adopt Believability Moods**

**Mood A — Understatement:**
Simplicity. Lack of color words. Fewer adjectives than expected. No superlatives. Short sentences that fall rather than rise in tone.

VW example — complete ad:
> "You never run out of air. You also won't have any worries about draining or flushing the radiator in spring. There is no radiator. Or hoses. Or water pump. Or rust." — (~line 13976)

**Mood B — Deadly Sincerity:**
Lean over backwards to point out flaws in your offer, so benefits will be believed more deeply.

> "TO THE MAN WHO WILL SETTLE FOR NOTHING LESS THAN THE PRESIDENCY OF HIS FIRM. And who is willing to make the incredible sacrifices necessary to get there in the shortest possible time." — (~line 14050)

**Source:** Ch. 13, ~lines 13664-14100

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 3

**IF** ad runs in a specific, trusted publication → **THEN** adapt format, typography, and phraseology to match that publication's editorial style.

**IF** the market is highly sophisticated/skeptical → **THEN** use understatement or deadly sincerity to break the "advertising" stereotype.

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

## 9. THE FINAL TOUCHES

**Source:** Chapter 14 — "The Final Touches" (~lines 14106-15904)

### 9A. VERIFICATION — Placement of Proof

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 2

> "Proof—like claims—is most effective when the reader unconsciously demands it, and when he is ready to accept its content as necessary and logical." — Ch. 14, ~line 14271

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 2

> "The placement of your proof is as important to its overall effect as the content itself." — Ch. 14, ~line 14210

**Rules for proof:**
- Keep it as short as possible, as dramatic as possible, as specific as possible.
- Proof copy must SELL — it cannot merely offer proof alone. It must make the prospect hungry to read every word.
- Stage your proof. Develop a drama into which documentation enters as the hero.
- Do NOT place proof only in headline, sub-head, or a separate box labeled "Here's Proof."
- INTERWEAVE documentation alongside promises, belief-words, momentum-builders, image-sharpeners, emotion-definers.

> "Documentation is inherently dull. Your job is to add excitement to it. You have to stage it. You have to develop a drama, in your reader's mind, into which your documentation enters as the hero." — Ch. 14, ~line 14412

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 2

**Distinctions between three types of belief-builders:**
- **Documentation** = outside proof (statistics, facts, tests, testimonials)
- **Mechanization** = verbal and logical demonstration that the product works (strength of logic/structure alone)
- **Verification** = the process of arranging your documentation within copy for greatest acceptance and emotional effect

**Source:** Ch. 14, ~lines 14436-14458

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### 9B. REINFORCEMENT — How 1+1=10

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 1

> "In mathematics, one plus one always equals two—never more. In emotional writing, one plus one can often equal ten. In other words, two emotional images, joined together in the right way, can often have TEN TIMES the impact that either of these images has by itself." — Ch. 14, ~line 14508

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 1-theoretical

### FORMULA | Layer 3

> "Position increases power." — Ch. 14, ~line 14376

One type of creativity = the ability to combine separate images into a new unity that is much more powerful than the mere logical sum of its parts.

**Example — Avis:** "We try harder" (good by itself) + "We're only second" (the reason why) = combined impact far greater than either alone. (~line 14518)

**Example — Deadly Sincerity reinforcement:**
> "This is John Horn's first book. He is not an accomplished writer, and it has flaws. If you read for style, or for literary quality, this is not your book. But there are paragraphs in this book—ideas in this book—whole chapters in this book—that have never been put down on paper before! And that may open doors to you—tomorrow—that otherwise might take a lifetime of waiting for you to walk through!" — (~line 14562)

The startling frankness of the first paragraph serves as an intensifying contrast making the second paragraph's claims far more believable.

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### 9C. INTERWEAVING — Promise + Logic + Emotion in Every Sentence

### PRINCIPLE | Layer 2

> "Every sentence you write of copy should contain not only promise... not only image... not only logic—but as much of all three as possible. Weave together your promise, your logic, your emotion, your image. Pack your sentences full of every one of them." — Ch. 14, ~line 14762

**Type:** PRINCIPLE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### EXAMPLE: Interweaving Analysis | Layer 4

A single sentence dissected for its interwoven elements:

> "And, most important, [mood-builder, indicating value] these experts [reference to authority] have discovered [scientific idiom = believability] that you do not have to be a handyman [core-promise] or a mechanic [restatement of core-promise] in order to coax [promise of ease] this performance [condensed promise of all prior claims] out of your set." — Ch. 14, ~line 14834

Seven different copy elements in one sentence—done unconsciously by the writer, absorbed unconsciously by the reader.

**Type:** EXAMPLE | **Layer:** 4-specific

### 9D. SENSITIVITY — Anticipation Points

### MECHANISM | Layer 2

> "Every ad has an architecture. This is the over-all pattern of the ad, including when and where and how many times you shift from one type of copy to another. It is the ability to recognize these shift points, and to change when you encounter them from—say—promise copy to mechanism copy to documentation copy to promise copy again, that makes your ad stick together, or fall apart." — Ch. 14, ~line 14926

**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 2

**IF** you feel a blockage while writing—a sense that the copy has suddenly gone dead → **THEN** you have passed an anticipation point. Stop. Think. Look for a new direction.

Signs you need to shift:
- Piling on promise after promise when the reader no longer believes you
- Burying the reader under statistics when he's already convinced and wants more promises
- Going straight when the reader wants to turn left

> "A new structure is a new ad. It brings out new ideas. Gives your promises new sharpness, new flavor, new believability and even begins to create whole new sections that you never dreamed were there in the product before." — Ch. 14, ~line 15400

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### 9E. MOMENTUM — Keeping the Reader Reading

### FORMULA: Two Types of Momentum-Builders | Layer 3

**Type 1: Momentum Phrases (Invitations to read on)**

- "They paid up to $22.50 a person to learn priceless techniques like these:"
- "You can learn them all, in your own home next weekend, without risking a penny. Here's how."
- "Here is the information you will find in this book."
- "Let me explain."
- "All I ask from you is this."
- "What you are going to do, in the very first hour that you receive the book, is this."
- "And yet it's only the beginning."
- "THEN put this simple trick to work for you—that VERY SAME HOUR."
- "For example—"
- "Read the thrilling answer below."
- "...to start with..."
- "Just wait till you try this."

**Type 2: Incomplete Statements / Teasers**

Create interest → raise a question → imply an answer later.

> "But now, when you turn on the ignition, a modern miracle of engineering science comes to life underneath your hood!" — (~line 15566)

> "Caught! 120 Fish in One Hour!" — (~line 15634)

> "Every one of these examples not only produces momentum, not only raises questions in the reader's mind that he virtually must read on to answer—but is also, at exactly the same time, loaded with sell." — Ch. 14, ~line 15656

**Source:** Ch. 14, ~lines 15428-15666

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### 9F. MOOD — Words and Rhythms as Emotion-Definers

### MECHANISM | Layer 2

> "Words and rhythms. They are to the copy writer what line and color are to the painter. They set the mood of your story—carry the emotion so subtly that your reader never really realizes where the excitement or the image or the conviction is actually coming from." — Ch. 14, ~line 15690

**Type:** MECHANISM | **Layer:** 2-strategic

### FORMULA: Two Types of Emotion-Definers | Layer 3

**1. Image-Sharpeners** — Words that create visual pictures: "weighted down... solid, blazing rows... so thick you can't even see a leaf in between."

**2. Emotion-Definers** — Words that tell the reader what to FEEL: "precious... that very morning... blinded... greets... you never imagined before."

> "These words are emotion-definers. They tell the reader what to feel about the images and ideas you are presenting to him. Their very essence is that they are so subtle that he does not see them." — Ch. 14, ~line 15750

**Type:** FORMULA | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### ANTI_PATTERN | Layer 3

> "Certain classes of readers will notice these emotion-definers. When they do, your copy becomes either questionable or corny to them, and you have lost them. Therefore, you have to know always whom you are writing for." — Ch. 14, ~line 15760

**IF** emotion-definers become visible to the reader → **THEN** you've lost them. Adjust tone to audience sophistication.

**IF** EVERYBODY sees your emotion words → **THEN** you have a bad ad. Rewrite fast.

**Type:** ANTI_PATTERN | **Layer:** 3-tactical

### DECISION_RULE | Layer 3

> "Read the ad out loud. See how you can almost scan it, as though it were close to blank-verse." — Ch. 14, ~line 15784

Different moods require different rhythms:
- **Color/beauty/excitement:** Rich, flowing, almost scannable rhythms with dense imagery
- **Power/momentum:** Machine-gun rhythm. Short, choppy sentences. Verb... verb... verb. Claim... claim... claim.
- **Sincerity:** Absence of adjectives where you'd expect them. Self-kidding. Builds corporate affection, then trust.
- **Honest appraisal:** Long, rather clumsy sentences that don't scan. Straight-from-the-shoulder phraseology.

**Type:** DECISION_RULE | **Layer:** 3-tactical

## 10. SYNTHESIZED AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

### PRE-WRITING CHECKLIST

Before writing ANY marketing copy, the agent must determine:

1. **Market Awareness Level** — How aware is the prospect of the product and its promise? (Determines headline approach from Part 1)

2. **Market Sophistication Level** — How many similar claims has the prospect already seen? (Determines whether to lead with promise, mechanism, or identification)

3. **Dominant Desire** — What is the single most powerful desire driving this prospect? (Determines the content of Intensification)

4. **Identification Needs** — What character roles and achievement roles does the prospect want the product to reinforce? (Determines Identification approach)

5. **Belief Barriers** — What does the prospect currently believe that could block the sale? (Determines need for Gradualization and Redefinition)

6. **Product Drawbacks** — Is the product too complicated, too unimportant, or too expensive in the prospect's mind? (Determines which Redefinition type to use)

7. **Competitive Landscape** — Is direct comparison with competitors needed? (Determines need for Concentration)

8. **Media/Channel** — What publication or medium will carry this copy? (Determines Camouflage approach)

### DECISION TREE: Choosing Primary Technique

```
START
  |
  v
Is the product category new/unfamiliar to the prospect?
  YES → Lead with GRADUALIZATION (build belief before claims)
  NO ↓
  |
Is the market highly sophisticated (many similar claims seen)?
  YES → Lead with MECHANIZATION (new mechanism in headline)
       OR CONCENTRATION (destroy competitor claims)
  NO ↓
  |
Does the product have the same performance as competitors?
  YES → Lead with IDENTIFICATION (build unique role/personality)
  NO ↓
  |
Does the product have a clear, unique performance advantage?
  YES → Lead with INTENSIFICATION (expand and sharpen desire)
  NO ↓
  |
Does the product have built-in drawbacks (too hard, too expensive, too trivial)?
  YES → Lead with REDEFINITION (remove the objection)
  NO ↓
  |
Default: Lead with INTENSIFICATION + IDENTIFICATION
```

### WRITING RULES — Ranked by Importance

**MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable):**

1. **Never violate the prospect's established beliefs.** Every statement must fit with the prospect's version of "the facts" at that precise moment. You cannot change beliefs; you can only extend them.

2. **One fully-believed promise beats ten half-believed promises.** Invest time in believability-structure rather than piling on claims.

3. **Every sentence must sell.** Including mechanism copy, proof copy, and transitional copy. No "dead" sentences.

4. **Never repeat the same phrasing.** You cannot repeat, but you CAN reinforce. Present the same promise in fresh settings.

5. **Never attack a competitor without simultaneously providing the solution.** Attack for the customer's benefit, not your own.

6. **Never force the prospect across a believability-chasm.** Always build a bridge from what they already believe.

7. **Never contradict the product's accepted primary image.** Build on it, use it as a foundation for broader images.

**SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations):**

8. **Pack every sentence with promise + logic + emotion.** Interweave elements so they reinforce each other.

9. **Use the language of logic throughout.** "Therefore," "here's why," "the reason is clear" — these words carry conviction by centuries of conditioning.

10. **Match copy tone to audience sophistication.** What works for one class of media may fail in another.

11. **Build proof into the copy flow, not into a separate section.** Stage your documentation as the hero of a drama.

12. **Use momentum-builders to keep the reader going.** Incomplete statements, teasers, and explicit invitations to read on.

13. **Use the guarantee as a climax, not an afterthought.** Summarize all performances, reinforced by the guarantee at every step.

**NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable):**

14. **Adapt format and phraseology to match the publication.** Camouflage the ad as editorial content.

15. **Use understatement or deadly sincerity to break the advertising stereotype** in highly skeptical markets.

16. **Read the ad out loud.** Check rhythms match the intended mood.

### POST-WRITING QUALITY CHECKS

After writing, verify:

1. **Belief Architecture:** Does every claim have preparation before it? Could the most powerful claim be delayed until after sufficient acceptance has been built?

2. **Anticipation Points:** At each paragraph break, is the reader demanding MORE of the same type of copy, or is he ready for a different type? Have you shifted when needed?

3. **Interweaving:** Does each sentence carry multiple elements (promise, logic, emotion, image)? Or are there "dead" sentences that only convey information?

4. **Reinforcement:** Are there juxtapositions where 1+1=10? Can two images be placed together for compound impact?

5. **Momentum:** Will the reader keep reading at every point? Are there teasers and incomplete statements that pull forward?

6. **Identification Test:** Does the copy give the prospect a ROLE, not just a product? Can someone identify WHO they become by using this product?

7. **Believability Scan:** Read the copy as a skeptic. At what point would you stop believing? That's where you need more Gradualization, Mechanization, or Verification.

8. **Tone Consistency:** Read the copy aloud. Does the rhythm match the mood? Are emotion-definers invisible or do they call attention to themselves?

9. **Competition Test:** Could you put another brand name on this copy without changing anything? If so, you need more product-specific mechanism or identification.

10. **The "Would I cite this?" Test:** Is every paragraph doing work? If a paragraph doesn't build desire, identification, OR belief — cut it.
