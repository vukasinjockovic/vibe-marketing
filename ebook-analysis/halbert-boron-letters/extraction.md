## 1. DECISION RULES

### DR-01: Market Before Product (Layer 0 -- Foundation)
IF you want to start a direct response business
THEN find a hot market (starving crowd) FIRST, then create or find a product for that market.
NEVER start with a product and then look for someone to sell it to.

> "The mistake is finding or developing a product FIRST and then looking for a market to sell it to. This is backasswards."
> "A guy with a new product cannot always find a hot market for that product but a guy who has uncovered a HOT MARKET can always find a product to fill the needs of that market."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 0

### DR-02: List Selection Hierarchy (Layer 1 -- Strategy)
IF selecting a mailing list / audience, rank by these criteria in order of importance:
1. RECENCY -- most recent buyers first ("hotline buyers" are 30-90 day purchasers)
2. FREQUENCY -- repeat buyers of similar products
3. UNIT OF SALE -- higher average purchase = hotter prospect

> "Of the three guidelines, RECENCY is, by far, the most important of all."
> "People don't always put their money where their mouths are; but they do nearly always put out their money where their true desires are."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 1

### DR-03: List Quality Escalation (Layer 1 -- Strategy)
When evaluating audience quality, apply this escalating filter:
1. Phone book names (terrible -- too much waste)
2. High-income area names (slightly better, still too broad)
3. Known high-income people by profession (reasonable)
4. Proven mail order buyers who are wealthy (good)
5. Wealthy MO buyers who bought similar products (very good)
6. Repeat buyers of similar products (excellent)
7. Repeat buyers who paid big money (near-best)
8. All of the above + very recent purchase (best rentable list)
9. All of the above + confirmed working for other mailers (best external list)
10. YOUR OWN SATISFIED CUSTOMER LIST (best of all)

> "THE BEST LIST OF ALL IS YOUR OWN CUSTOMER LIST!"
> "All other things being equal, your own customers should respond far better than any other list you can get."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 1

### DR-04: A-Pile vs. B-Pile (Layer 2 -- Tactical)
IF creating direct mail or email
THEN design your envelope/subject line to land in the "A-pile" (personal-looking mail) not the "B-pile" (obviously commercial).

A-pile characteristics: no teaser copy on envelope, first-class stamp (not bulk indicia), handwritten or typed address (not label), plain return address (no company logo), personal salutation inside.

B-pile characteristics: company name on corner card, bulk rate permit, cheshire label, teaser copy ("WOW! Exciting news inside!").

> "Everybody always opens all of their 'A' pile mail."
> "If only half as many people open your envelope, only half as many even have a CHANCE to order!"

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2

### DR-05: Attention Grabber Relevance Rule (Layer 2 -- Tactical)
IF using an attention device (physical object, unusual opening, grabber)
THEN it MUST tie in naturally with the message. It must be relevant and make sense.
NEVER use cheap tricks or bait-and-switch attention.

> "Your 'attention grabber' should be relevant. It should tie in with your message. It should make sense."
> "People resent this kind of fraud. Don't do it."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2

### DR-06: Customization Rule (Layer 2 -- Tactical)
IF you can customize your message to the recipient's profession, location, name, or situation
THEN always do so -- the more custom-tailored, the more successful.
Double customization (profession + location) is even more powerful.

> "As a general rule, the more 'custom tailored' your promotion is, the more successful it will be."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2

### DR-07: Editorial Disguise Rule (Layer 3 -- Copy Structure)
IF writing an ad for placement in a publication
THEN make it look like editorial content, not advertising.
Editorial content gets 5x the readership of advertising.

> "In most publications, the editorial content gets 5 times as much readership as the advertising content."
> "YOU CAN DO A BETTER SELLING JOB WHEN AT FIRST IT DOES NOT APPEAR YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO A SALES JOB."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 3

### DR-08: Proposition + Reason-Why Rule (Layer 2 -- Tactical)
IF making a special offer or deal
THEN always provide a believable "reason why" you are offering the deal.
The most powerful reason: "You are special by virtue of some unique circumstance."

> "When you say, in effect, 'Have I got a deal for you!' you need an explanation as to why you are offering this good deal."
> "If you don't have an explanation, your 'deal' won't be believable."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2

### DR-09: Sell to Behavior, Not Words (Layer 0 -- Foundation)
IF researching what people want
THEN observe what they ACTUALLY BUY, not what they SAY they want.
Watch repeating ads, mailing list sizes, and actual purchase data.

> "The way to deduce what people want to buy is to simply observe what they DO buy!"
> "Truth can be determined NOT by how people use their mouths, but rather, how they use their wallets."
> "Be skeptical of what people say. Be skeptical of surveys. Of questionnaires. Instead, believe in numbers."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 0

### DR-10: Closing Allocation Rule (Layer 3 -- Copy Structure)
IF writing a sales letter or ad
THEN devote up to 25% of total space to closing the sale.
Be extremely specific about what to do: fill out coupon, enclose payment, use the envelope, mail it TODAY.

> "Sometimes I devote as much as 25% or more of the entire ad to closing."
> "Tell him to do all this RIGHT NOW! TODAY!"
> "Tell him what he will get if he hurries and tell him what he will lose if he delays."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 3

### DR-11: HALT Decision Rule (Layer 0 -- Foundation)
IF you are Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired (HALT)
THEN never make an important decision.
Instead: write, run, walk, jog -- move until you clear the deck.

> "HALT stands for hungry, angry, lonely, and tired, and you should never make a decision when you are any of those things."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 0

### DR-12: Reduce Before Expand (Layer 2 -- Tactical)
IF a catalog or multi-product offer bombs
THEN reduce to fewer products and use a personal letter with a photo.
A personal letter selling 1 item outperformed a 70-item catalog ($40M vs. less than break-even).

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 2

### DR-13: Emotional Turning Points (Layer 1 -- Strategy)
IF you can reach people at emotional turning points (just had a baby, just married, just lost someone, just got promoted, just filed bankruptcy, just bought a car)
THEN they are far more responsive to relevant offers.

> "A lot of money can be made by making offers to people who are at an emotional turning point in their lives."

Type: DECISION_RULE | Layer: 1

## 2. FORMULAS & TEMPLATES

### F-01: AIDA Formula (Layer 3 -- Copy Structure)
The sequential structure for every sales letter:
1. **ATTENTION** -- Grab focused attention with a relevant device (physical object, startling fact, personal opening)
2. **INTEREST** -- Feed interesting facts, statistics, details about the opportunity
3. **DESIRE** -- Help the reader "picture with pleasure" the benefits of owning what you sell
4. **ACTION** -- Tell them exactly what to do, step by step, RIGHT NOW

> "AIDA stands for ATTENTION, INTEREST, DESIRE, ACTION."

Type: FORMULA | Layer: 3

### F-02: The 7 Steps to Direct Mail Success (Layer 1 -- Strategy)
1. Find a hot market (mailing list)
2. Find or create a product (preferably paper and ink) to sell to that market
3. Create a direct mail promotion describing the product and its benefits
4. Make a test mailing (1,000 to 5,000 pieces)
5. Analyze results
6. If results are good, mail 20,000 to 100,000 more letters
7. If results are still good, start rolling out and taking care of business

Type: FORMULA | Layer: 1

### F-03: Pre-Writing Research Template (Layer 3 -- Copy Structure)
Before writing, assemble a file containing:
1. List cards describing test lists
2. A copy of the product you intend to sell
3. Copies of DM pieces others used for similar products
4. Copies of space ads others used for similar products
5. Copies of books and reports in the product's subject area
6. Copies of exceptionally good ads/DM pieces (even unrelated)
7. A headline collection / swipe file
8. Anything else that could be an "idea generator"

Read everything. Take "nugget notes" -- short, fragmented observations. Star the best (*, **, ***). Then STOP. Let it sit for a day or two. Wait for the "aha experience."

Type: TEMPLATE | Layer: 3

### F-04: Nugget Notes Method (Layer 3 -- Copy Structure)
1. Read all assembled materials
2. Write observations as short nuggets (single words, phrases, fragments -- don't censor)
3. Include: product descriptions, page counts, author facts, what the product DOES for the buyer, specific benefits (better car, nicer house, peace of mind, vacations, attract opposite sex, leisure time)
4. Rate: * = good, ** = better, *** = red hot
5. Put it away for 1-2 days
6. Breakthrough idea emerges
7. Write according to AIDA formula

Type: TEMPLATE | Layer: 3

### F-05: Dollar Bill / Grabber Letter Template (Layer 3 -- Copy Structure)
```
[Physical object attached to top of letter]

[Day, exact time, date, year]

Dear [First Name],

I am attaching [object] to the top of this letter for two important reasons:

First of all, what I have to say to you is very serious and I needed
some way to be sure to get your attention.

And secondly, [tie the object to your message/offer in a natural,
relevant way]...

[Continue with AIDA flow]
```

Type: TEMPLATE | Layer: 3

### F-06: Coat-of-Arms Letter Template -- Personal + Photo (Layer 3 -- Copy Structure)
```
Dear Mr. [Name],

I thought you might like to see what the [Name] [product/thing]
looks like in [full color / completed form] so I am sending you
the enclosed [snapshot/sample].

[Reason why this exists specifically for them]

[Reason why they get a special deal]

[Call to action]
```

This template generated $40 million in sales. Key: it looks personal, not commercial.

Type: TEMPLATE | Layer: 3

### F-07: "You Are Special" Proposition Template (Layer 2 -- Tactical)
The most powerful deal structure makes the customer feel uniquely positioned:
- "Since your name is [X], we have a very limited market..."
- "Since you are one of the world's leading [profession]..."
- "A mutual friend of ours, [Name], said I should write you because..."
- "Since you have proven yourself to be an astute judge of [X]..."
- "Did you know there are only [specific number] [Name] families in the entire U.S.?"

Type: TEMPLATE | Layer: 2

### F-08: Winning Formula / Customization Engine (Layer 1 -- Strategy)
When you find a promotion that works for one audience:
1. Keep the core content the same
2. Customize the opening, headline, and specific details for each new audience segment
3. "How [Profession] Can [Benefit]" -- swap profession for each list
4. Repeat across all available compiled lists

> "If this idea actually works, we have something much more valuable than our $9,920.00 profit... what we have is a 'winning formula'!"
> "Ideas breed other ideas."

Type: FORMULA | Layer: 1

## 3. PRINCIPLES & MECHANISMS

### P-01: The Starving Crowd Principle (Layer 0 -- Foundation)
The single most important advantage in marketing is not better copy, better product, lower prices, or better location. It is a starving crowd -- a market with intense, pre-existing demand.

> "'The only advantage I want,' I reply, 'is A STARVING CROWD!'"
> "What I am trying to teach you here is to constantly be on the lookout for groups of people (markets) who have demonstrated that they are starving (or at least hungry!) for some particular product or service."

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 0

### P-02: Student of Markets, Not Products (Layer 0 -- Foundation)
The first and most important thing to learn is what people want to buy. Not products, not techniques, not copywriting, not media buying. Markets first.

> "The very first thing you must come to realize is that you must become a 'student of markets.' Not products. Not techniques. Not copywriting."
> "Sell People What They Want To Buy!"

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 0

### P-03: Enthusiasm Is the Money Engine (Layer 0 -- Foundation)
Money follows enthusiasm, not the other way around. Pursue what excites you. Hire the most enthusiastic person, not necessarily the most qualified.

> "Money, in my opinion, especially big money, is most often a by-product of enthusiasm."
> "Always look for the most enthusiastic person, not necessarily the most qualified."

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 0

### P-04: Observation Over Survey (Layer 1 -- Strategy)
People lie to themselves and others about their preferences. The National Enquirer is the largest-selling newspaper in the world, yet "nobody reads it." People say they prefer plays to movies but buy movie tickets 10,000x more. Observe actual purchasing behavior.

> "If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck -- guess what? It's probably a duck!"

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 1

### P-05: First Impression Determines Everything (Layer 2 -- Tactical)
The sale/no-sale decision is largely made the instant a prospect sees your ad and reads your headline. If the first impression gives them a "lift," they will read looking for reasons to buy. If not, they will never recover.

> "I believe the 'sale' or 'no sale' decision is largely made the instant a prospect sees your ad and reads your headline."
> "When a person goes for a job interview, the interviewer decides whether or not to hire that person in the first 40-seconds."
> "We unconsciously spend the rest of our so-called decision-making time not really making a decision after all, but instead, searching for justification for the decision we have already made."

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 2

### P-06: Believability Through Specificity (Layer 3 -- Copy Craft)
Exact details increase believability enormously. Replace vague claims with precise numbers.
- "most car owners" becomes "77.6% of all car owners"
- "you can lose lots of weight" becomes "the average reported weight loss over a 31-day period was 37.5 pounds for men and 26.3 pounds for women"
- Incidental details ("it's the blue one") draw the reader closer and make everything more real.

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 3

### P-07: Paper and Ink Products (Layer 1 -- Strategy)
The ideal product for direct response is paper and ink (reports, books, information products). Low fulfillment cost, high margins, easy to create, easy to customize.

> "I am especially interested in selling paper and ink and, specifically, written reports that solve a problem for the people on the mailing list."

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 1

### P-08: Movement Cures Creative Block (Layer 0 -- Foundation)
When stuck, confused, or emotionally jammed up, the answer is physical movement and continued output. Run, walk, write, do dishes -- do not sit and wait for inspiration.

> "When you get stuck or emotionally jammed up one of the ways to get yourself unclogged and flowing again is just to keep moving."
> "The key is movement!"
> "You Don't Have To Get It Right... You Just Have To Get It MOVING!"

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 0

### P-09: Write for Money, Not Applause (Layer 4 -- Craft Refinement)
The best writing goes unnoticed. If someone says "that was well written," you have failed. The goal is orders, not compliments. Style emerges naturally from practice.

> "If you are writing for applause... you will go home with empty pockets!"
> "Write for money!"
> "The very best writing goes unnoticed."

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 4

### P-10: Internalize Through Handwriting (Layer 4 -- Craft Refinement)
Copy proven winning ads by hand. This physically imprints the flow, sentence structure, and rhythm of great copy into your nervous system. Do this for months.

> "What happens when you actually write out a good ad in your own handwriting is that the words, the flow, the sentence structure, the sequence of information, and everything else about the writing of that ad becomes a part of you."

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 4

### P-11: Physical State Affects Mental Output (Layer 0 -- Foundation)
Your physical condition directly determines the quality of your thinking and writing. Road work (walking/jogging) first thing in the morning, proper diet, and fasting produce the "survival chemicals" (endorphins/norepinephrine) that sharpen thinking.

> "How You Feel Affects How You Think."
> "This is why writers need a strict routine which gives them the best possible chance to be in a pretty good mood for work."

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 0

### P-12: Control Over Copy (Layer 2 -- Tactical)
Never let clients rewrite your copy. The copywriter must maintain iron-fist control. Clients who override copy decisions consistently produce failed ads.

> "Part of the reason I am in so much demand is that I am so hard-headed."
> "Can you imagine how disastrous it would be if a patient could tell his surgeon how to do the operation?"

Type: PRINCIPLE | Layer: 2

## 4. ANTI-PATTERNS

### AP-01: Product-First Thinking
Starting with a product and then looking for a market. This is the single most common mistake.
> "The mistake is finding or developing a product FIRST and then looking for a market to sell it to. This is backasswards."

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 0

### AP-02: Trusting Surveys Over Behavior
Asking people what they want instead of observing what they buy. People give "right" answers, not true answers.
> "The surveyed people were trying to give the 'right' answer."

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 1

### AP-03: B-Pile Design
Making your mail or message obviously commercial: teaser copy on envelopes, bulk rate indicia, cheshire labels, company logos.

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 2

### AP-04: Irrelevant Attention Grabbers
Using shocking or misleading attention devices that don't connect to the message. ("A Submarine That Flies?")
> "A cheap shot. People resent this kind of fraud."

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 2

### AP-05: Forbidding Layout
Long sentences, long paragraphs, narrow margins, small type, no white space. Makes the reader decide not to read before reading a single word.
> "Have you ever looked at a piece of writing and decided not to read it because it looked so forbidding?"

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 3

### AP-06: Writing for Applause
Trying to sound clever, literary, or "well written" instead of writing to sell. Style that calls attention to itself.
> "If you are writing for applause... you will go home with empty pockets!"

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 4

### AP-07: Showing the Order Card Too Soon
Letting the reader see the commercial materials (order card, brochure) before reading the sales letter. They will jump to it, see the price, and decide before being sold.
> "We want our reader to see this stuff at the proper time. AFTER HE HAS READ OUR LETTER!"

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 2

### AP-08: No Reason-Why for Special Deals
Offering a discount or deal without explaining why. Destroys believability.

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 2

### AP-09: Vague, Abstract Language
Using corporate/abstract phrasing ("dramatically increase your sales volume") instead of concrete, visual language ("make yourself a bushel of money").
> "The words 'dramatically increase your sales volume' do not even begin to conjure up the visual imagery of 'a bushel of money.'"

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 3

### AP-10: Too Many Products at Once
Offering a catalog of 70 items instead of focusing on 1-3. The catalog bombed; the single-item personal letter generated $40M.

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 2

### AP-11: Making Decisions While HALT
Writing, strategizing, or negotiating while Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired.
> "HALT stands for hungry, angry, lonely, and tired, and you should never make a decision when you are any of those things."

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 0

### AP-12: Waiting for Inspiration
Sitting around waiting for a flash of genius instead of just starting to write and move.
> "Don't sit around waiting for a flash from Heaven. It doesn't work that way."

Type: ANTI-PATTERN | Layer: 0

---

## 5. CONCRETE EXAMPLES

### E-01: The Coat-of-Arms Letter
A one-page, 361-word letter selling family name research reports. Generated 7,156,000 cash-with-order customers. Mailed to names from white pages of phone books (a "terrible" list by Halbert's own criteria, proving a great offer can overcome list weakness). The follow-up catalog of 70 items bombed. A personal letter with one photo of the best item generated $40M.

Type: EXAMPLE | Layer: 2

### E-02: The Diamond and Ruby Buyers List
SRDS list: 52,000 names, 60% buyers, $5,000 average unit of sale. $156 million in total purchases. Demonstrates using SRDS to find starving crowds.

Type: EXAMPLE | Layer: 1

### E-03: The Pregnant Mothers Promotion
120,000 new names per month. Product: "How To Raise Your Child's IQ Before It Is Even Born!" at $19.95. Projected $58,200/month profit. Demonstrates emotional turning point targeting.

Type: EXAMPLE | Layer: 1

### E-04: The Beer Survey
A beer company surveyed customers: 80% said they preferred premium beer. Sales data showed most bought regular beer. People give the answer they think they "should" give.

Type: EXAMPLE | Layer: 0

### E-05: National Enquirer Paradox
The largest-selling newspaper in the world, yet almost nobody admits to reading it. "It must be all those Martians."

Type: EXAMPLE | Layer: 0

### E-06: The Robert Collier Dollar Bill Letter
A fundraising letter with a real dollar bill attached. Explained the writer divided his $1,000 contribution into 1,000 bills and mailed each one asking recipients to forward it to a children's hospital with their own donation. Got better than 90% response. "Probably the most effective direct mail promotion ever mailed."

Type: EXAMPLE | Layer: 3

### E-07: The Japanese Penny Promotion
A letter with a Japanese coin attached. Copy: "I'm attaching this for two reasons. First, to get your attention. Second, because what this letter discusses was discovered in Japan." Relevant grabber = worked like crazy.

Type: EXAMPLE | Layer: 3

### E-08: The Chiropractor Customization Play
33,000 chiropractors as a compiled list. Headline: "How Chiropractors Can Make Extra Money." $9,920 net profit from one segment, then replicate the "winning formula" across plumbers, architects, dentists, etc.

Type: EXAMPLE | Layer: 1

### E-09: "The Amazing L.A. Roadmap to Real Estate Riches"
A report concept developed live during writing. Demonstrates: finding a list (real estate investment book buyers), creating a product (extracting best ideas from 3-4 books, adding original insights), customizing by location and profession ("How Cardiologists Can Buy L.A. Real Estate With No Money Down").

## 6. AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

### AI-01: Pre-Writing Research Checklist
Before writing ANY direct response copy:
1. Identify the target market / list / audience segment
2. Determine what they have ALREADY BOUGHT (not what they say they want)
3. Find recency, frequency, and unit of sale data
4. Gather competing promotions (swipe file)
5. Read 3-4 books or sources in the product's domain
6. Take nugget notes with star ratings
7. Let it sit -- wait for the central selling idea to emerge
8. Only then begin writing

### AI-02: Copy Structure Decision Tree
```
START: Do I have attention?
  NO  -> Add a relevant grabber (physical object, startling fact,
         personal detail, photo)
  YES -> Continue
  |
  v
Is the opening personalized?
  NO  -> Add name, profession, location, or situation customization
  YES -> Continue
  |
  v
Am I feeding interesting facts?
  NO  -> Add specifics: numbers, statistics, details about the opportunity
  YES -> Continue
  |
  v
Am I creating desire through sensory "picture with pleasure" language?
  NO  -> Add word pictures: what they see, feel, smell, experience
  YES -> Continue
  |
  v
Is 20-25% of copy devoted to closing?
  NO  -> Add step-by-step ordering instructions, urgency, and loss framing
  YES -> Review and read aloud
```

### AI-03: Copy Quality Rules (Ranked)
MUST-FOLLOW:
1. Make it look personal, not commercial (A-pile, not B-pile)
2. Use an attention device that ties in naturally with the message
3. Follow AIDA: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action
4. Be specific -- exact numbers, not vague claims
5. Write for money, not applause -- invisible style
6. Use short words, short sentences, short paragraphs
7. Provide "reason why" for every deal or claim
8. Hide the order form until after the pitch is read
9. Close with extreme specificity: tell them exactly what to do
10. Tell them to act RIGHT NOW

SHOULD-FOLLOW:
11. Customize: profession, location, name, situation
12. Use transition words to keep flow: "Well," "Now," "And so," "Onward"
13. Ask questions and answer them yourself
14. Use parenthetical asides for eye relief and intimacy
15. Include day/date/time for immediacy
16. Describe where you are writing from for intimacy
17. Read the finished copy out loud -- rewrite any stumbles

### AI-04: Word Picture Standards
Replace abstract language with concrete, sensory imagery:
- BAD: "dramatically increase your sales volume"
- GOOD: "make yourself a bushel of money"
- BAD: "our product provides relaxation"
- GOOD: "the feel of that soothing bubbling water against your bare skin is just plain heaven"

The reader should be able to feel the sand in their toes, smell the salt air, see the sunset.

### AI-05: Believability Injection Points
At every claim, add one of these:
- Exact number: "77.6% of all car owners"
- Specific timeframe: "over a 31-day period"
- Incidental detail: "it's the blue one" in parentheses
- Reason-why: explain WHY the deal exists
- Source citation: name the expert, study, or authority
- Limitation admission: "this only works for people who..."

### AI-06: Layout and Formatting Rules
- Wide margins
- Double spacing between paragraphs
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences online)
- Serif typeface for letters
- Good crisp white paper (or clean digital layout)
- Red for emphasis color
- "(over)" or "(go to page X)" directives to guide the reader
- Photos should be crisp, clean, glossy -- never cheap or soggy
- Large colorful stamps (or equivalent visual quality markers)
- The layout should look like an exciting editorial piece, not an ad
