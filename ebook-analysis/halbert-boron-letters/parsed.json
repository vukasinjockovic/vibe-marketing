Halbert whose hard-hitting, no- B.S. Style, coupled with a brilliant and experienced marketing mind, is nothing short of a mental kick to the head which will give you a real inside look at exactly how to create great marketing campaigns that  make millions upon millions of dollars.\n\n Many people consider Gary Halbert to be the greatest copywriter in history, and they make a great case.\n\n Gary has had more multi-million dollar winning campaigns in more industries than any other copywriter, living or dead.\n\n His sales letters, ads, and other promotions have generated sales which can only be measured in the BILLIONS.",

He was also a great mentor to many of today’s best copywriters and to his many fans from around the world, who read his breakthrough newsletter, The Gary Halbert Letter.\n\n To them and many more of today’s top money makers, he was simply a godsend.\n\n Besides being the guy who wrote one of the most widely mailed sales letters in history, Gary had a really eccentric and fascinating life.\n\n His tale is a true rags to riches story and he once wrote…”I have been robbed, tied up, gagged, blindfolded, threatened. I’ve made and lost millions. I have been eulogized, ostracized, and plagiarized. I’ve also… been both a prison guard and a prison inmate.”\n\n It was during his ten months in California’s Boron Federal Prison Camp the letters in this book were written to his youngest son, me.",

And since they were published, the no- holds-barred letters have become a cult classic among marketers for good reason.\n\n The simple letters were designed to be a crash course on direct marketing, as well as a crash course on life. The letters were never meant to be republished as-is. However, they were eventually published as- is, and the lessons in them have since changed many lives.\n\n To this day, I receive phone calls, letters, and communications from around the world from grateful fans testifying how the Boron Letters have changed their lives.\n\n These letters are the greatest gift I have ever received, and in a short while you will see exactly why .",

As you know, today is my birthday and, strange as it may seem, it hasn't been a bad one under the circumstances. For one thing, I got your birthday letter and the cards your Mom sent me and, for another, today is the first day I was able to run \"the hill\" non-stop. Being able to do that really made me feel good. The hill is a real son of a gun. It is very steep\n\n and, by my calculations, it is about 8/10 of a mile. I went around the hill 5 times for a total of 4 miles and, as I said, on one of those circuits (the third one), I did it running (actually it was more of a slow jog) non-stop.",

And, before I am finished, I'll bet you I can run around that hill ten times (8 miles) without stopping .\n\n Well, anyway, this all leads me to the first and most important thing I want to write about, which is improving and maintaining your health and physical fitness. I'll have a lot more to say about this subject later, but today, I just want to \"warm up\" a little bit and tell you a few good ideas that you can start using every day.   The first thing I want to talk about is \"road work.\" Road work is walking, jogging and running. And, in my opinion, you should do about one hour of road work every day of the week except Sunday. I believe the best time to do your road work is right after you get out of bed.",

Just get out that front door and start moving. Walk, run, jog. Keep moving for about 1/2 hour and then turn around and come back. You know, I really do believe this is the very best way in the world to start the day. It cleans you out, it settles you down and it gives you a nice glow that will stay with you throughout the day. It will also make you more clearheaded and improve the quality of your thinking.

Perhaps I'll write more about my new \"get tough\" attitude in a later letter, but for now, I want to get right back to this road work business.\n\n You know Bond, I can't stress how strong I feel that doing an hour's worth of road work is perhaps the number one most valuable habit you can cultivate. You see, if you start your day this way, it will get you off to a great start. It will vastly improve the rest of your day since it will drain off a lot of tension and anxiety and, in general, it will clear out your mind so you can think better all day long!\n\n Plus, after you get into it, it will make you feel great!",

And, I intend to keep fasting one day a week (at least) for the rest of my life. When you fast, you begin to normalize your body functions and also, you develop a certain self-discipline that will help you in most other areas of your life. I intend to write a lot more about fasting later on, but for right now, I just want to encourage you to begin immediately to fast one day every week.",

First of all, I suggest you do not tell other people what you are doing. Most people don't understand fasting and all you will get from them on this subject is a lot of ignorant babble. Secondly, I feel that you should do very little (or no) athletic exercise on the days that you fast. You see, your \"Fast Day\" is the day you set aside to give your mind and body a rest. You don't have to stay in bed all day or anything like that but you really should take it easy both physically AND mentally .\n\n What I do on my fast days is sort of kick back and read and putter around and, also, I have found it a good time to take care of those nagging little chores and errands that seem to accumulate during the rest of the week.\n\n In other words, I think you should do road work every morning to more or less \"order your day\" and fast every week in order to \"order your week.\"",

You can start right now before you are even 16 years old. God, what a head start you will have!\n\n Now, let's go on. The next thing I want to talk to you about is your diet. First of all, I believe that everybody who says breakfast is the most important meal of the day is dead wrong. In my opinion, all you should eat before lunch is a couple pieces of fruit. Do you remember what I said to you in yesterday's letter? I said you should eat a piece of fruit (preferably a banana) before you start your road work.",

I said you should eat a piece of fruit (preferably a banana) before you start your road work.\n\n Well, after your road work, in my judgment, what you should do is take a shower, clean up, and get dressed and get your day started. And then, sometime after that, before lunch, you should eat another piece of fruit. Actually, you should eat three pieces of fruit every day (except when you fast) and I think you can't miss with a banana, an apple, or an orange. This way, you will get your potassium and your vitamins (and something called pectin, all of which is very good for you!).\n\n Incidentally, I have read, and I believe it to be true, that fruit is the prize food of man. Also, I believe that fruit is perhaps the number one food category that Americans need to eat more of.\n\n Watch your Mom. Watch other people. How much fruit do they eat? Very little I'll bet, and they are missing out on something very, very important.",

But for now, it would be an excellent idea if you would start eating three pieces of fruit everyday, and start right after you get this letter.\n\n You know Bond, in addition to everything else, you are the best student I have ever had and it is a real joy to teach all these things to you. Boy, I sure wish my dad had been able to do this for me, but that's water over the dam.\n\n But maybe we can start a tradition here.

What else should you eat? Well, one thing is sure: You should definitely eat a big bowl of some \"bran type\" cereal. Grapenuts is probably the best you can find in an ordinary grocery store, and some health food stores have cereals that are even better.\n\n By the way, remember yesterday when I asked you to get a copy of \"The Joy Of Running\"? Well, here are two other books you should look for: \"The Miracle of Fasting\" by Paul Bragg and \"Are You Confused?\" by Paulo Airola. Many health food stores will probably carry both of these books.\n\n By the way, I don't want you to feel like you have to write to me as much as I am writing to you.

There's an old tomcat around here at the camp named Crackers. Crackers is an arrogant cat. There is a lot of small game around here and Crackers like to catch these little critters and plays with them.\n\n For example, a week or so ago, I was doing my morning road work and I spotted Crackers as I was coming down the backside of \"The Hill.\" Crackers had a little critter in his mouth that looks just like a baby chipmunk.

Crackers caught it again in short order and began to repeat the whole process. What I mean is that he would carry it in his mouth and then drop it and then torment it until finally the poor thing had no fight left .\n\n In other words, Crackers just messed with this little squirrel until he tormented the life out of it. And then, after all this, do you know what else he would do? What he would do is pick up the squirrel again in his mouth and toss his head back and throw it up in the air and then bat it back and forth while it was in the air like he was playing handball with it.",

In life, everyone must learn to deal with unnecessary grief from other people, but sometimes you are faced with a jerk who has the balance of power in their favor.\n\n And the only way to survive, especially with your pride intact, is to develop a mental toughness as a form of mental armor.

More protein, of course. As I said, you'll get some protein from your milk but it won't be nearly enough. You should also have at least one serving of some kind of lean meat or fowl.\n\n Hamburgers are fine too.\n\n Go easy on eggs. Two or three a week is plenty.

I'm going to dive right back into the subject of becoming a \"student of markets.\"\n\n As you know, once in a while, I give a class on copywriting and/or selling by mail. One of the questions I like to ask my students is: \"If you and I both owned a hamburger stand and we were in a contest to see who would sell the most hamburgers, what advantages would you most like to have on your side?\" \n\n The answers vary. Some people say they would like to have the advantage of having superior meat from which to make their hamburgers. Others say they want sesame seed buns. Others mention location. Someone usually wants to be able to offer the lowest prices.\n\n And so on.",

I, myself, only want one advantage and, if you will give it to me, I will whip the pants off of all of you when it comes to selling burgers!\" \n\n \"What advantage do you want?\" they ask.\n\n \"The only advantage I want,\" I reply, \"is A STARVING CROWD!\" \n\n What I am trying to teach you here is to constantly be on the lookout for groups of people (markets) who have demonstrated that they are starving (or at least hungry!) for some particular product or service.",

A brief explanation follows:\n\n Recency - The more recently a person has purchased (by mail) something similar to what you are selling, the more receptive he will be to your offer. Get 'em while they're hot! In fact, always check to see if the list you are interested in has \"hotline buyers\" and see if you can rent them before anybody else. Hotline buyers are the most recent buyers of all. Sometimes they will be 90-day hotline buyers or even 30-day hotline buyers. These names are extremely good prospects!",

If you are selling a book on skin diving and you can find a list of people who have purchased several other books on skin diving, then you know he is interested in the subject and will be a likely prospect to buy your book .\n\n Unit of sale - Once again, we have a guideline that just plain makes sense. After all, a person who recently paid $100.00 for a bottle of diet pills is probably a hotter prospect for diet type products than a person who has only paid $10.00 for a bottle of diet pills.\n\n You know, Bondo-Dog, people don't always put their money where their mouths are; but they do nearly always put out their money where their true desires are.",

There is, as you shall see when you start using the book, a big section devoted to compiled lists. All compiled lists are, by the way, names and addresses of people or businesses or institutions or whatever that have something in common.\n\n For example: brick layers, architects, chiropractors, churches, businesses who do a $500,000 gross every year, business who do $1,000,000 every year, YMCA's, police stations, veteran purchasing agents, etc., etc.\n\n O.K., here's my idea: What if you took the following headline:\n\n How You Can \n Make Extra Money \n\n And, then you customize it to something like: \"How Architects Can Make Extra Money\" or \"How Churches Can Make Extra Money\" or \"How Chiropractors Can Make Extra Money\" etc., etc .",

The second part of the book would contain money-making techniques that would uniquely apply to a particular group of people, such as architects or chiropractors. (By the way, chiropractors are greedy so they would be one of my first targets!)\n\n Anyhow, let's say our report is finished and so, now, we write a letter incorporating the idea that I previously expressed in those sample headlines. Perhaps the letter would start out like this:\n\npart0012 \n \n \n Dr. Charles L.

Now at a 4% response we will get 1,320 orders. Multiply 1,320 orders times $20.00 per order, and we will have total sales of $26,400. When we subtract our mailing cost of $13,200 from our sales revenue, we have left $13,200. Now we must also subtract our cost of filling the orders. Since it shouldn't cost more than $4.00 apiece on the outside, our total fulfillment cost will be $4.00 per order times 1,320 orders, or $5,280.00. When we subtract this figure from the $13,200 we have left, we will be left with a net profit of $9,920.00 .\n\n Not a fortune but not to be sneezed at either.

I think this way of doing things bonds the writer and the reader closer together. It also gives our transmission the quality of immediacy.

Now, when it comes to reply envelopes, you basically have two choices. The options are to make the reader pay the postage when he mails the envelope, or for you to pay the postage for him.

Therefore, I believe, when either or both of the following conditions exists, you should test a SRE (Stamped Reply Envelope) :\n\n Condition #1 : You are selling a high-ticket item where the profit structure is such that one additional sale per thousand letters mailed will yield more than enough profit to pay for your SRE's.\n\n This means, of course, that each sale you make has to have a mark up of at least $200.00.",

If they bring in three extra orders per M, the mark up would only have to be $70.00 per unit to make it feasible.\n\n And so on.\n\n Condition #2 : You should test a SRE whenever you can make the recipient of your letter feel guilty if he doesn't reply.

I'm talking about, of course, the good old standby known as a BRE or \"Business Reply Envelope\".\n\n You've seen thousands of BRE's.

They have the advantage of making it easy for the customer to reply plus the advantage of being much cheaper than a stamped reply envelope.\n\n The reason they are cheaper is that you only pay the postage (and BRE fee) for those envelopes that are actually mailed back to you.\n\n However, they also have some disadvantages. Like these:\n\n              They slow up your mail. The post office has to tabulate how many BRE's you get each day so they'll know how much you owe. This will hold up your mail ( and your cash flow !) for at least one extra day. Maybe more. ",

And, in truth, this is a disservice to him. Because, quite often, after he reads your info he will discover that what you have to offer has genuine value to him. So try to strategize your mailings so that he at least reads your letter before he makes a decision. \n\n               You can't do good guilt with a BRE. SRE's are much better for this purpose. \n\n \n And now, let's talk about yet another type of reply envelope. I call it the PSH envelope. PSH stands for \"Place Stamp Here\".

I think a solution to your mom's money problems just popped into my mind!) \n\n \n Now, of course, this envelope isn't as personal as an SRE but it is more than a regular BRE.

As I said, they should look (the ads) \"editorial.\" However, they should not look like just any old editorial piece of writing. No. Your ads should look like an exciting piece of editorial material.\n\n Here is a way to think about it: Imagine that you have written a book that you want to become a best seller. What's the best thing that could happen? Well, how about this? Suppose a guy who works as a reporter for the L.A. Times gets a copy of your book, reads it, and falls in love with it.\n\n Now, let us further imagine that this reporter likes your book so much that he writes a full page article about our book and tells all his readers how wonderful this book is and why they should buy a copy.

Well, perhaps he would write his friend a letter and tell him the same things he told his newspaper readers.\n\n And, perhaps he would even include a snapshot of the book so his friend would know what to look for in case he wanted to go to a bookstore to get the book. This would be one hell of a sales pitch, wouldn't it? You bet it would, and that's how your DM letters should look.\n\n Here is a true story. Once upon a time, I wrote a letter to sell a product I dreamed up which was a family name research report.

It sounded great to me. So, what I did is I went off on a camping trip by myself and there, all alone in the woods, I created a 5-1/2 x 8-1/2 four color catalog which featured about 70 attractive items that could be ordered personalized with my customer's family crest.\n\n It bombed.",

And don't even try to guess why at this point because I'll explain it before I am finished.\n\n Meanwhile, back to my story: As I was saying, there was a lot of things I didn't do and I'd like to talk about why I didn't.\n\n The first reason I didn't get tough with this guy is I was a little scared. Not much, because I am in very good shape and I am a very physical person now. But I was a little scared and with good reasons and here are some of them. First of all, this guy might have hurt me. He's pretty physical too and he has been working out in prison for years. Secondly, I might have hurt him because, as I said, I'm not exactly a guy who routinely gets sand kicked in his face.",

And, if you will look at that letter you will see that my handwriting was somewhat shaky because of all the adrenaline working in my system.\n\n But I did write the letter to you and then I took a walk and I went to my \"thinking spot\" and I plotted out my schedule for the month of July.\n\n And this morning what I did is I did 8 long miles of roadwork on the hill.

It goes like this: \"You can have any 10 records you want right now for only 99¢ if you agree to buy an additional record every other month for the next two years.\" Another very common \"deal\" or proposition is: \"If you buy right away you will get a big discount.\" And another is: \"I'll give you a discount if you buy more than one.\" And, of course, the most\n\n STOP\n\n 11:35\n\n START AGAIN\n\n 4:46\n\n common proposition of all is simply: \"If you give me X dollars I will give you X product!\" ",

Here's how some of my deals work:\n\n What I am doing is going through the SRDS list book and looking for mailing lists that I think will yield a good profit if exploited properly.\n\n O.K., after I have identified the list I want to go after I then start thinking about a product to sell to that list. By the way, I am especially interested in selling paper and ink and, specifically , written reports that solve a problem for the people on the mailing list.

If he likes the project (and they nearly always do) what they do is they put up roughly about $5,000.00 to get everything going. This five thousand is used to develop the report I want to sell, to rent the test names, to pay all costs of the test, etc.\n\n Then what happens is I create the DM promotion and have B. put it into the mail.
