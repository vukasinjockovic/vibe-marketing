 Build a Facebook Page That Makes Serious Money. 

 For years, people have been saying that Facebook is “dead” — that it’s only for 

 older generations, a platform no one uses anymore. 

 But here’s the truth: 

 Facebook is still the largest and most powerful social platform in the world with 

 billions of monthly active users and a highly engaged audience. 

 I know this not because I read a headline, but because I’ve been building pages 

 on Facebook since 2013, and I use them to drive traffic to my websites, and 

 generate consistent online income long before Facebook even started paying for 

 content. 

 Now Facebook is paying out real money to content creators through its new 

 Content Monetization Program and most people don’t even know it exists. 

 In 2024, Facebook paid out over $2 billion to content creators through that 
even know it exists. 

 In 2024, Facebook paid out over $2 billion to content creators through that 

 program. 

 It’s an invite-only program, but there are ways to get invited. Once you're in, 

 you can post daily and get paid at the end of the month. 

 And guess what, the people who are taking advantage of this program are 

 people like me who figured out how to build faceless Facebook pages that 

 generate thousands of dollars a month. 

 Last month, one of my pages earned over $7,000. 

 

 Another page brought in more than $4,000. 

 The month before that, that very same page also made $4,300. 

 

  

 Facebook is consistently paying me over $4,000 a month for that one page. And 

 I own 10 of these pages, and every single one of them brings in consistent 

 income every month. 

 And the best part is that 

 You don’t need to be famous. 
s in consistent 

 income every month. 

 And the best part is that 

 You don’t need to be famous. 

 You don’t need to be a tech genius. And you don’t need to be on camera. 

 You don’t even need to create all the content from scratch, you just collect it 

 from the internet. 

 I haven’t created content from scratch in the last 3 years, I either curate it or 

 use AI. 

 Inside this course, I’m going to teach you exactly how to do the same, from 

 choosing the most lucrative niches, to setting up your pages for monetization, 

 to growing fast with real U.S. based audiences that boost earnings 

 So, if you’ve ever dreamed of making money online without showing your face, 

 this is the opportunity. 

 Let’s go.

 So what is a Faceless Facebook Page? 

 A faceless Facebook page is a content-based page that makes money without 
aceless Facebook Page? 

 A faceless Facebook page is a content-based page that makes money without 

 showing your face, name, or personal identity. (though you could use your 

 personal one) 

 The content of it takes the form of images, text posts, videos, stories, 

 carrousels, polls, and reels. 

 I post mainly just images and text posts. 

 When set up right, these pages can earn thousands per month via Facebook’s 

 Content Monetization Program and website traffic, all while you stay 

 anonymous. 

 All you need is viral content and a strategy that works. 

 Back in 2013 when I started my online-money making journey, creating content 

 was difficult. 

 There was no AI. I used to hire freelancers on platforms like Fiverr, pay them 

 per article (based on word count), manage revisions and all that to just have 

 something to post on my blogs and my Facebook pages. 

 It was time-consuming, expensive, and exhausting. But everything has changed 
 my Facebook pages. 

 It was time-consuming, expensive, and exhausting. But everything has changed 

 now. 

 Today AI tools can generate high-quality, engaging content in seconds. It’s 

 simple, fast, cheap, and gives you a constant stream of posts, without burnout. 

 All you need is to know how to prompt better, find viral ideas, generate AI-

 powered content, find proven formats that work, and start posting on your 

 page. 

 (But we will get to that later in this course with examples)

 How to Choose the Right Niche? 

 This is where the money is made, before you even start. 

 The first step in creating a successful Facebook page is choosing the right 

 niche… trust me it’s so important.

 No amount of content or strategy will take your Facebook page far if you choose 

 the wrong niche.
 No amount of content or strategy will take your Facebook page far if you choose 

 the wrong niche.

 A great niche has three things: a wide audience, high RPM, and evergreen. If you 

 pick a niche with these three things, you can make serious money on Facebook. 

 But if you go with one that barely pulls 1,000 views with low RPM, good luck, 

 you’re not going to earn much.

 Step 1: Pick a niche you can stand to work on 

 You don’t have to love it, but don’t pick something you hate because you’ll be 

 managing your page for years. If it drains you, the page will likely fail. 

 If you don’t have passion, pick something neutral. Just don’t force yourself into 

 a niche that makes you miserable. 

 Let’s say you’re a stay-at-home mom who loves cooking, you can start a recipe 

 page, post recipes daily, and start making money. It’s that simple. 

 Step 2: High RPM niches

 page, post recipes daily, and start making money. It’s that simple. 

 Step 2: High RPM niches 

 Different niches pay different rates. that’s why it’s INCREDIBLY important to 

 pick a high-earning, viral-friendly niche from the start. Here are 15 high RPM 

 and top-performing niches on Facebook right now: 

 1. Gardening & Home : Evergreen, visual, huge reach, and excellent ad revenue. 

 2. Health & Wellness : Fitness, nutrition, mental health, natural cures — always 

 relevant. (Avoid surgery and medical advices if you’re not a doctor) 

 3. Christian/Inspirational : Consistent audience, emotional, strong 

 monetization. 

 4. Animals & Pets : Viral goldmine. Think stories, rescues, pet news. 

 5. Motivational/Mindset : Quotes, rags-to-riches stories, daily habits, 

 productivity. 

 6. Finance & Economics : Stock tips, money-saving hacks, economic news. Needs 

 a viral spin. 

 7. Travel: Dream destinations, tips, news, travel hacks. 
, economic news. Needs 

 a viral spin. 

 7. Travel: Dream destinations, tips, news, travel hacks. 

 8. Self-Improvement : Book summaries, life hacks, goal setting, morning 

 routines. Works well with carousel and story posts. 

 9. Parenting & Family Life : Relatable mom/dad content, parenting wins and 

 fails, life with kids. Emotional and shareable. 

 10. Food & Recipes : Especially budget-friendly, healthy, quick meals, or 

 nostalgic food. Strong performance with U.S. women 30+. 

 11. Life Tips / Life Hacks : Bite-sized advice, productivity tips, things school 

 never taught you. Easily goes viral. 

 12. Fun Facts & Did You Know : These perform extremely well, especially when 

 paired with engaging visuals or carousel format. 

 13. Education & Learning : Language tips, brain facts, school hacks, or 

 psychology concepts. Good RPM and easy to batch content. 
age tips, brain facts, school hacks, or 

 psychology concepts. Good RPM and easy to batch content. 

 14. Relationship Advice : Safe, non-toxic dating or marriage tips. Can be tricky — 

 avoid controversy or gender bashing. 

 15. Success & Business Tips : Entrepreneurship, passive income tips, freelancing 

 ideas. Just keep it motivational, uplifting and positive not too pitchy. 

 There are many more, but these are the top niches that consistently perform 

 well on Facebook and earn high RPMs. Each one has strong growth potential, 

 attracts U.S. audiences, and delivers solid earnings. 

 Choose wisely, this single decision is very important if you want to build a 

 successful Facebook page. 

 Niches to Avoid 

 Some niches have low RPM, hard to monetize, or get your page flagged. You 

 need to avoid them if you're serious about making money: 

 1. Celebrity gossip – Risky, copyright issues, short shelf life. 
're serious about making money: 

 1. Celebrity gossip – Risky, copyright issues, short shelf life. 

 2. Memes-only pages – Fun, but very low RPM and rarely sustainable. 

 3. Low-quality humor or cringe content – Doesn’t attract advertisers. 

 4. Overly controversial or NSFW – Can get demonetized fast. 

 5. Anything dependent on copyrighted material – Like movie clips, music 

 videos, etc. 

 If it’s risky, cheap, or hard to scale, kip it. Stick with valuable, advertiser-

 friendly content that builds long-term income. 

 Page Setup 

 Now that you have selected your niche, time to set up your page and start 

 posting content. Here’s a step-by-step guide to launching a clean, professional, 

 and profitable page: 

 Step 1: Create the Page 

 Go to Facebook’s Create Page. 

 For example, let’s create a page called LifeProTips. 

 Step 2: Choose the Right Page Name 
Page. 

 For example, let’s create a page called LifeProTips. 

 Step 2: Choose the Right Page Name 

 Your name should be clear, keyword-friendly, and brandable. 

 Step 3: Upload a Logo 

 Use Canva to design a clean, simple logo. Keep it readable at 

 small sizes. Use bold fonts, high contrast, and a circular format. 

 

  

 Step 4: Add a Cover Image 

 Design your cover in Canva as well, make it visually appealing, niche-relevant, 

 and professional. Don’t waste too much time 

 on these things, aim for a simple logo like I did. And you can always change 

 later.

 Step 5: Fill Out the Description 

 Keep it short and benefit-driven. Example: Tips that improve your life in one 

 way or another. 

 Step 6: Select the Right Category 

 Pick Personal Blog, motivational speaker or News & Media Website depending on 
the Right Category 

 Pick Personal Blog, motivational speaker or News & Media Website depending on 

 your niche. 

 Step 7: Add a Call-to-Action Button 

 Use “Follow” or “Visit the group” to let people join your Facebook page group 

 as well. 

 I prefer building a Facebook group simultaneously. So instead of “Send a 

 message” link your group for people to join it. 

 Step 8: Add another profile 

 The next step now is to add another profile as admin to your page in case you 

 lost access to the profile you created the page with. That could be your second 

 profile, your mom’s, or your wife’s, or anyone’s profile that you know and trust. 

 Just make sure every profile you add as an admin in your page has no violations 

 history with Facebook.

 Content creation 

 Now your page is set up and ready to start posting content. 

 But before that we need to know what size and what formats perform well on the 

 platform. 

 And I want you to keep in mind that the Facebook algorithm loves engaging, 

 emotional, and valuable content. 

 You’re not there to post for fun or waste your time, you’re there to post what 

 prints money. 

 And to find what bounces with your audience, you will need to test different 

 types of content such as memes, text only posts, images plus text and so on. 

 All must be related to your niche. 

 But don’t worry, we are not going to re-invent the wheel here. I literally 

 included the exact strategy I use to find viral content. 

 So what sizes and formats work best (Based on my experience) 
rategy I use to find viral content. 

 So what sizes and formats work best (Based on my experience) 

 When it comes to image size, always use 1080 x 1350 pixels. This vertical 

 format is ideal for visibility and tends to drive higher engagement, as it takes up 

 more screen space in the feed. 

 As for content formats, Facebook’s algorithm tends to favor certain types over 

 others. 

 While the best format can depend on your niche, the following ones consistently 

 perform well across all pages: 

 1.Image + Text. 

 I’ve found this to be the most effective format for going viral, both for me and 

 many of my competitors. 

 Here’s a couple examples: 

 This one went viral because it’s emotional and people tend to engage with this 

 type of content. When people feel something, they share it. Emotion always 

 beats logic when it comes to attention. 

 

 This one brings back memories, so Anything that brings back memories goes 
comes to attention. 

 

 This one brings back memories, so Anything that brings back memories goes 

 viral on Facebook because the core audience on Facebook is old. the majority 

 are millennials and boomers. 

 

  

 This one uses a question, and questions get people talking. More comments 

 mean more reach, which means more money. Facebook loves posts that keep 

 people on the app. 

 

 2. Text posts only 

 Text only posts tend to perform well on Facebook. They feel more personal, 

 like a direct thought or note. The simpler the post, the easier it is for people to 

 stop, read, and react. 

 

 3. Trendy content (viral trends) 

 When something is already in the spotlight, like Taylor Swift getting engaged, people 

 are more likely to comment, share, and react because it’s trendy and relatable. 

 

  

 4. Interactive content (e.g.: pick one among 4 in one, one has to go, eliminate one, 
ble. 

 

  

 4. Interactive content (e.g.: pick one among 4 in one, one has to go, eliminate one, 

 choose one, how to…) + short caption. 

 

 

 

 5.Highly charged emotional content: 

 

 

 6.Inspirational content 

 

  

 7. Nostalgic content 

 

 Nostalgic content performs really well on Facebook because the platform’s audience tends to be older. Anything that brings back memories or reminds people of the “good old days” gets more likes, comments, and shares. 

 10. Timely celebrity quotes 

 

  

 You can use Canva to create any of the above designs, they’re easy to make. 

 11. Thread posts 

 

  

 Facebook does not have thread buttons like X or Threads.com, but you make a 

 thread by posting, then adding more parts in the comments under your own post. 

 Each new comment continues the post. 

  

 How to do it 
ts in the comments under your own post. 

 Each new comment continues the post. 

  

 How to do it 

 1. Post your main idea or hook 2. Comment under your own post with Part 1 3. Add more comments for Part 2, Part 3, etc. 4. Pin your best comment if needed 5. Reply to people in the same thread to keep it active 

  

 The only downside to this content format is that you can’t schedule them, you 

 have to post them manually. 

  

 All of these content formats should be related to your niche.

 Best Optimal Times to Post 

 Now that you know what type of content that goes viral on Facebook, let me 

 tell you when to post. 

 For a maximum reach and engagement with content, and based on my 

 experience for USA, the best time to start posting is from 8.30 am to 11:30pm 

 (in EST — USA Time) 

  

 I always post at half-past the hour because almost no one else is posting then. 
 — USA Time) 

  

 I always post at half-past the hour because almost no one else is posting then. 

 Most content creators post on the hour. Trust me, I’ve tested different times, 

 and half-past consistently performs best—whether you're scheduling or posting 

 manually. 

 Post your most viral-worthy content at 8:30 am , 8:30 pm , or 

 11:30 pm. 

 You may ask yourself why? 

 Well, at 8:30 am , your post shows up as one of the first things people see when 

 they wake up. 

 At 8:30 pm , people are winding down and checking apps after work. 

 At 11:30 pm , especially on weekends, people are scrolling before bed. 

  

 In the beginning aim for 6 to 8 posts a day , one post every two hours. And as 

 your page starts to grow, you can post up to 14 posts a day, and between each 

 post keep 60 minutes of time. 

 (You don’t need to post them manually; you can schedule them using the 
 keep 60 minutes of time. 

 (You don’t need to post them manually; you can schedule them using the 

 Facebook built-in tools.) Will get to that later. 

 Bottom line: 

 Facebook's algorithm favors recency + engagement. 

 So post when people are active and ready to interact, don’t post at night when 

 people are sleeping. 

 Timing + content = your reach multiplier. 

 When to Repost the Content that went viral for you for Maximum ROI 

 Reposting basically means free money with less efforts. 

 If something went viral for you once, it can do it again. 

 When to Repost: 

 2 to 4 weeks after original postdate (avoid reposting too soon) 

 During the same time slot/day it originally performed well 

 During trending seasons (e.g., repost “fall recipes” every September) 

 How to Repost Smart 

 • Change the hook or caption slightly to refresh 
ecipes” every September) 

 How to Repost Smart 

 • Change the hook or caption slightly to refresh 

 • Swap the thumbnail image if it’s a video • Use insights from your original post: time, format, caption style. 

 Don’t 

 Don’t repost every viral post. Be selective and aim for top 10% performers only. 

 Don’t repost it in under a week, Facebook may throttle repeated content that 

 feels spammy. 

 Use Facebook Insights to Find Your Winners 

 Spend some of your time daily on Facebook Insights. It shows you what content 

 gets the most engagement, so you can double down on what works. 

 Go to your Facebook Page. 

 In the left-hand menu, click on “Insights” (or use Meta Business Suite). 

 Under the “Content” tab, scroll to find your Top Posts. 

 Click the drop-down to sort by Reach or Engagement (likes, comments, shares). 

 Take note of the posts with: 

 The highest Reach 

 The most Comments 

 The most Shares

 Those are your proven winners, and you can repost them. 

 How To Raise Your Facebook Page RPM. 

  

 Most people think views alone decide how much money they make on Facebook. 

 That’s wrong. 

 Your page earnings are heavily affected by who sees your content, from where, what niche you are in, and how your posts are presented. 

 Here are the parts most creators ignore when it comes to RPMs. 

 1. Low RPM Countries and Why They Hurt Your Earnings 

 Facebook does not always show your content only to the audience you expect. 

 Even if your page is based in the US, Facebook may push your posts to low RPM countries. When that happens, your views go up but your money does not. 

 This is one of the biggest reasons pages get millions of views and still earn very little. 
 not. 

 This is one of the biggest reasons pages get millions of views and still earn very little. 

 Low RPM countries pay far less for ads. The same post can make 10x more money if viewed in a high RPM country. 

 How to solve This Problem 

 Go to your Facebook Page Settings 

 Find Country Restrictions 

 Add only high RPM countries where advertisers pay more 

 Focus on countries like: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany and other high rpm countries. 

 

 

 if you don’t use the first option, which is to show only to high RPM countries, at least ban those countries that are not yet eligible for Facebook content monetization because you make $0 from them as they’re ineligible. 

 Here’s a list of countries that are eligible for content monetization: 

 https://www.facebook.com/business/help/267128784014981 

 Pages that ignore this settings bleed money without knowing why. 

 2. Your Niche Decides Your Ceiling 
es that ignore this settings bleed money without knowing why. 

 2. Your Niche Decides Your Ceiling 

 Not all niches are paid the same. 

 Some niches get massive views but low ad demand. Others get fewer views but much higher payouts. 

 High RPM niches usually include: Finance, Business, Self-improvement, Education, Technology, Health and Fitness, Food and recipes… and so on. the list is long… 

 Low RPM niches often include: Random memes, Generic entertainment, Reposted viral clips with no theme, celebrities… 

 If your goal is money, your niche choice matters more than going viral. 

 A boring post in a strong niche often pays more than a viral post in a weak niche. 

 3. Captions 

 Captions are so important when it comes to RPMs, They affect: 

 • Dwell time 

 • Engagement 

 • Distribution 

 • Monetization 

 Bad captions kill good content. 

 Good captions do three things: 
Distribution 

 • Monetization 

 Bad captions kill good content. 

 Good captions do three things: 

 1. Hook attention in the first line 2. Give context without over explaining 3. Push interaction naturally 

 4. And most importantly include high RPM keywords. 

 Facebook reads captions to understand who to show your content to and link up your page with the right advertiser/bidders. 

 Facebook monetization is not luck. 

 It is small decisions stacking together: 

 • Audience location 

 • Niche strength 

 • Caption quality 

 • Text overlay clarity, known as TOBI. 

 Fix these, and the same content can earn multiples more without extra work. 

 How to Grow from 0 to 10k+ Followers (Fast) 

 Let’s assume you’re starting from zero and the page is brand new, here’s your 

 step-by-step on how to hit your first 10,000 followers. But before that post at 

 least 20 posts on your page, you don’t wanna invite people to follow an empty 
efore that post at 

 least 20 posts on your page, you don’t wanna invite people to follow an empty 

 page. 

 Step 1: Invite Your Friends 

 Ask your friends and family to follow and share it.

 Step 2: Share to Relevant Facebook Groups 

 Join highly engaging niche-related groups (not spam groups), and start sharing 

 your page’s content there. 

 Step 3: Use Facebook’s Built-In Invite Tool 

 

  

 After each post, Facebook lets you invite people who liked, reacted, or 

 commented to follow your page for free, up to 1000 invites daily! 

 Do this after every viral post to convert post viewers into long-term followers. 

 Step 4: Run Page Like Ads (The Shortcut) 

 The fastest and the best way to grow your page is to run a page likes ad

 If your niche, for example, is food recipes, put a hearty/mouthwatering food image in the middle and tweak the ad copy a little bit, but keep the same format. 

 Put a short caption, 4 words on top of the creative, image in the middle, 3 

 words at the bottom + the pointing finger graphic. 

 You can use Canva to design these Ad creatives. 

 Step 7: Publish Your Ad 

 Double-check everything, especially your audience, placements, and budget. 

 Then click the “Publish” button. 
k everything, especially your audience, placements, and budget. 

 Then click the “Publish” button. 

 Your ad will go into review , which usually takes less than 12 hours. 

 Step 8: Test More Creatives 

 Add 3 more ad creatives, all related to your niche. 

 Run them for 24 hours to see which one costs less. 

 Turn off the ones that cost more, and replace them with new Ad creatives. 

 Look at Cost per Page Like (CPL) — a good CPL is $0.01– $0.04. 

 If CPL is too high, test new images. 

 If results are good, increase your budget by 20% every week (don’t scale too 

 fast). 

  

 So, 

 Use Page Likes Ad Campaigns via Meta Ads Manager. 

 Optimize for low CPM and long-term ROI. 

 Initially give it $5, then increase the budget by %20 every week to avoid higher 

 cost.

Violations or copyright issues 5. Spammy or low-effort content 6. You applied too early and when the review came, your page wasn’t 
5. Spammy or low-effort content 6. You applied too early and when the review came, your page wasn’t 

 eligible/ready. 

 Myths: 

 You don’t need to be verified, none of my pages is verified. That’s a myth. 

 Focus on consistency, quality, and follower location. 

 To increase your chances of getting into the monetization program, create 

 another page and work on them simultaneously. Choose different niches, and 

 this way you’ll increase your chances of getting an invite from Facebook to get 

 monetized. 

 Don’t: 

 Don’t stop posting after you apply. 

 Don’t panic if it takes a few weeks to even 3 months to be accepted, keep 

 posting. The invitation to the program will come.

 How Do I Get My Facebook Page Approved Fast for Content Monetization 

 Forget about what’s circulating online that Facebook content monetization 
r Content Monetization 

 Forget about what’s circulating online that Facebook content monetization 

 invites come in waves, or that it's hard to get the invite, or that the program is 

 closed. 

 None of that is true. And whoever is saying that either doesn’t know what 

 they’re talking about or is just talking for the sake of talking or their page is not 

 compliant with Facebook guidelines. 

 Facebook wants content and pays billions a year to legit content creators. And 

 here's my exact method I use to get approved in a short period of time. 

 I literally got 10 pages approved this way, and each one in less than 2 months 

 using this method. 

 Here’s the strategy to get the invite: 

 After creating the page, completing the setup, and posting enough content, I 

 run a Facebook page likes ad campaign, following the strategy I explained 

 previously in the course. 

 I start with $10 or $5 a day for the first week. 
rategy I explained 

 previously in the course. 

 I start with $10 or $5 a day for the first week. 

 Then in the second week, I raise the ad spend by 20%. 

 Third week, another 20%. 

 Same thing in the fourth week. 

 Remember not 30% and not 40%. The ad cost will go higher if you increase fast. 

 Here’s the breakdown: 

 Week 1 

 Daily spend = $10 

 Weekly spend = $10 × 7 = $70 

 Week 2 

 Daily spend = $10 × 1.2 = $12 

 Weekly spend = $12 × 7 = $84 

 Week 3 

 Daily spend = $12 × 1.2 = $14.40 

 Weekly spend = $14.40 × 7 = $100.80 

 Week 4 

 Daily spend = $14.40 × 1.2 = $17.28 

 Weekly spend = $17.28 × 7 = $120.96 

 By the end of Week 4, I gradually reduce the page likes budget by 20% every 48 

 hours till I’m back to $10/day or even $5/day. I don’t cut it off suddenly — I 

 reduce it slowly so Facebook still sees steady momentum. 

 Also in the fourth week, I start running engagement ad campaigns. I spend $3 a 
 steady momentum. 

 Also in the fourth week, I start running engagement ad campaigns. I spend $3 a 

 day for 24 hours. Then I go into the campaign, edit it, change the post, or add a 

 new one. I do that every day for the whole week. 

 Why do I do all this? 

 Because Facebook wants to see momentum in both follower growth and 

 engagement. 

 If you go from 0 to 10k followers in a week, it can look spammy. 

 But if you show steady growth week by week, with solid content and 

 engagement, it would looks organic and real. 

 And while I’m doing all this, I’m posting viral content consistently, about 6 to 8 

 posts daily, every single day. 

 That’s how you trigger the invite. 

 Things to Avoid So You Stay Monetized 

 

 Protect Your Page to Protect Your Profits. 

 Once you’re monetized, your number one priority is staying compliant with 

 Facebook’s guidelines. Losing monetization is like turning off the money faucet. 
 compliant with 

 Facebook’s guidelines. Losing monetization is like turning off the money faucet. 

 Don't let it happen over careless mistakes. 

 Avoid These at All Costs: 

 Repetitive Content: If you're posting the same type of video/image repeatedly, 

 even across different formats, Facebook will flag you for "low-quality" content. 

 Plagiarized/Unoriginal Content: Copying content from TikTok, YouTube, other 

 pages, or Google without transformation or credit is a surefire way to lose 

 monetization. Always make it your own or add value. 

 Spammy Posts: Posting clickbait headlines, excessive emojis, links in every 

 caption, or misleading thumbnails can get your reach throttled — or worse, 

 demonetized. 

 Engagement Bait: Don’t use "Like this if you agree" or "Tag 3 friends to win!" in 

 a forced, unnatural way. Facebook penalizes this tactic. 

 Policy Violations: Avoid anything with violence, nudity, misinformation, or 
nalizes this tactic. 

 Policy Violations: Avoid anything with violence, nudity, misinformation, or 

 political disinformation — even in the comments under your post. 

 Page Inactivity: Pages that go dark for long periods can lose monetization 

 status. Post consistently, even if it's just 3–4 times a week. 

 Stay original. Stay clean. And treat your page like a business — because it is. A 

 few shortcuts may look tempting but can cost you everything you've built.

 Hacks to Explode Reach & Engagement 

 These are the tactics I use to trigger Facebook’s algorithm and go viral 

 repeatedly. 

 Write Long, Emotional Captions (150–200 characters) 

 Forget short, generic lines. Write like you're telling a story or giving real value. 

 This makes people stop scrolling, increasing dwell time, which signals the 
or giving real value. 

 This makes people stop scrolling, increasing dwell time, which signals the 

 algorithm to boost your post. But it should not sound like pure AI. Add some 

 human touch to your captions. 

 Structure: 

 Hook: Grab attention in the first sentence 

 Value: Tell a story, share insight, or make it relatable 

 CTA: Ask a simple question or prompt Interaction or excitement. 

 Here’s a couple an example: 

 1. OMG, this made my family stop talking for 15 minutes, you got to try it. 

 (recipe image). 

 2. do people still eat this in 2025… (recipe image). 

 You need captions that trigger engagements. find 20 viral pages in your niche and 

 see what viral captions they use and what formula and use them as well with 

 some tweaks here and there. 

 Share to Groups (But Be Smart) 

 Join 5 to 20 relevant Facebook groups. And post once per day in each one of 
roups (But Be Smart) 

 Join 5 to 20 relevant Facebook groups. And post once per day in each one of 

 them. BUT groups should be active. 

 Use Your Network 

 Ask friends to like, comment, and share within the first hour of posting. This 

 early engagement can help trigger the algorithm. 

 Once your page grows to 20k to 40k followers, you don’t need to do that 

 anymore. Facebook automatically pushes your content to non-followers. 

 More Little-Known Growth Hacks: 

 1. Comment on viral posts in your niche using your page (not your profile)

 2. Run a post engagement campaign with a $3 budget for 24 hours to gain 

 initial traction. After 24 hours, edit the campaign and switch the post to a new one. Repeat this daily for a week until your page starts showing consistent engagement.

 3. Mix content (text posts, images, interactive content)

 4. Use tags like @topfans, @commentors, and @followers in the first 

 comment occasionally. 
ent)

 4. Use tags like @topfans, @commentors, and @followers in the first 

 comment occasionally. 

 5. Test thought-provoking (but non-toxic) topics to spark engagement. 

 A great way to find these engagement posts is to go to Reddit, find AskReddit 

 subreddit then sort posts by Top → All Time , then look for questions that relate 

 to your niche. Take the best ones and post them on your Facebook page to fuel 

 comments, shares, and discussion 

 

 

 Facebook group 

 Facebook lately is pushing content that is being published in groups like crazy. 

 Oftentimes you see trending posts on Facebook are actually group posts. 

 Therefore, if you grow your group and post your page content there, it will help 

 your page to grow, gain more followers and boost your earnings. 

 Groups drive consistent reach, even when the algorithm slows your page down. 

 Facebook lately started giving extra bonuses for posts that perform well when 
ws your page down. 

 Facebook lately started giving extra bonuses for posts that perform well when 

 cross-posted to public groups. And I believe more monetization options will be 

 available in the future for groups as well. 

 How to create one: 

 Go to your Facebook profile → Pages → Create a Page → Name it. 

 Choose a clear, descriptive name that reflects the group's purpose and aligns 

 with your page's niche. 

 Write a concise group description with rules, goals, and what members can 

 expect. 

 Set the group to "Public" for visibility not "Private" for private groups that can't

 Pretty much the same strategy for growing a Facebook page. 

 Here’s how you can grow it strategically: 

 Share the group link on your Facebook page, and encourage followers to join. 

 Invite friends manually 

 Use the “Invite Followers to Group” Feature 

 Facebook gives you the possibility to automatically invite your page followers to 

 join your page group. Use the feature, it will save you time and effort 

 

  

 Post Engaging Content Regularly 

 Share valuable content like tips, questions, polls, or niche-related updates 7 

 times per week or more. 

 Use visuals (images, videos) to boost engagement; posts with media perform 

 better. 

 Pin a welcome post with group rules and an intro to keep new members 

 oriented. 

 Encourage Member Participation 

 Ask open-ended questions to spark discussions (e.g., "What's your biggest

 Respond to comments and posts promptly to show you value members' input. 

 Create weekly themes or challenges to keep the group active and inclusive. 

 Promote the Group Strategically 

 1. Cross-promote the group on your Facebook page. 2. Share the group in relevant groups (if allowed), don’t be spammy about it. 

 3. Moderate it yourself or add trusted moderators among members. 

 4. Set clear rules to maintain a respectful, inclusive environment (e.g., no 

 hate speech, no self-promotion). 

 5. Approve or decline posts/members quickly to keep the group active and 

 safe. Highlight active members with shoutouts. 

 6. Track Growth and Adjust

 9. Share one or two of your most viral page content into the group daily. 

 Tips for Success 

 Be consistent but avoid overwhelming members with too many posts. 

 Focus on quality over quantity; a smaller, engaged group is better than a large, 

 silent one. 

  

 Stay authentic and align content with your page’s mission to attract the right 

 audience. 

 Use the tag @everyone occasionally in the first comment to trigger engagement 

 in the group. 

 Pin a high-value post with a CTA (comment, share, tag). 

 Encourage UGC (user-generated content) to build interaction. 

 Use polls and questions to spark daily engagement. 

 Growing a group doesn’t just add value — it multiplies revenue. Start it early, it 

 will help you massively to grow other pages as well.

 Drive Traffic to your Website for more money with display ads and Affiliates 

 Facebook doesn’t like sending users off the platform, but website owners still 

 generate millions of clicks to blogs, online stores, and affiliate sites every single 

 day. You just have to do it strategically. 

 I make 5 figures a month driving traffic from social media to my blogs. And 

 Facebook is the best platform to do that. 

 Why? 

 Facebook does not have bots, just real people, safe and the audience likes to 

 read. I’m telling you this because over the past 10 years, I tried Native ad 

 platforms like Taboola, Outbrain and others and they’re full of bots. You pay 
 I tried Native ad 

 platforms like Taboola, Outbrain and others and they’re full of bots. You pay 

 per link clicks to drive traffic to your site, and all what you get is mostly bots. 

 That’s why Facebook is the best, cleanest traffic source out there. 

 Step 1: Build the Foundation 

 Start with either: 

 A blog/website monetized with Google AdSense, Ezoic, or Mediavine 

 A niche store (drop shipping, print-on-demand, or affiliate products) 

 Or a review site with affiliate offers from Amazon, ClickBank, or ShareASale 

 Make sure the website looks clean, loads fast, and is mobile- friendly — over 90% 

 of Facebook traffic is mobile. 

 How to Drive Traffic to Your Blog the Right Way 

  

 Avoid putting links in the captions, Facebook throttles reach when it detects 

 external links in the captions. 

  

 Instead:

 Where to Find Viral Content for Your Facebook Page 

 You don’t need to crank out original content every day. The smartest Facebook 

 pages, like BuzzFeed, Tasty, The Dodo, LADBible, Bored Panda… and others pull 

 in big audiences and make millions of dollars a year by curating and tweaking 

 what’s already out there. 

 They grab ideas from the internet or platforms like Reddit, google, Instagram 

 and TikTok, then make them their own. 

 Here’s how they do it: 

 They spot what’s blowing up online. 

 Put their own spin on it with a fresh angle or voice. 

 And share it in a way that hooks their followers. 

 This isn’t about ripping off content by the way, all TVs and Journals do it, it’s 

 about finding what works, adapting it ethically, and making it fit your vibe. 

 You’re not throwing darts in the dark, you’re following data and trends, then 
 it fit your vibe. 

 You’re not throwing darts in the dark, you’re following data and trends, then 

 adding your flavor. And if you do that the Facebook’s algorithm will start seeing 

 your page as a go-to for engaging posts, which means more reach for your page 

 and more money. 

 Here’s where and how to find viral content: 

 Use Facebook Itself (Your #1 Goldmine) 

 Once you’ve chosen your niche, follow 20 successful pages on Facebook that are 

 killing it in your niche. 

 Over time, Facebook’s algorithm will automatically feed you viral content in 

 your feed from similar pages. 

 Study their content daily, I mean literally study them, what they post, when 

 and how. Then start creating similar content to theirs. You can also visit their 

 websites and see what they’re publishing. 

 To make it even easier for you, use this tool to spy more on other pages, it’s 
ey’re publishing. 

 To make it even easier for you, use this tool to spy more on other pages, it’s 

 free for that reason. You can add up to 75 pages and spy on them daily for free. 

 Strevio.com: Add your competitors’ Facebook pages in there and get insights 

 into their top-performing posts, perfect for reverse-engineering what’s going 

 viral for them. Create similar ones and post them in your page, et voila. 

 This tool is also good if you want to schedule content and gives the possibility to 

 post a link in the first comment for a scheduled post. 

 Reddit (Crowd-Approved Gold) 

 Reddit is where content goes before it goes viral on Facebook. Find subreddits 

 related to your niche (ex: r/FrugalLiving, r/GetMotivated, r/Cats) 

 Use the sort by → Top → All Time feature 

 → You'll instantly see what content earned the most upvotes (a.k.a. social 

 proof).

 Other ways to Find Trends in Your Niche Before Others Do 

 Catching trends early gives you a serious advantage. You can be first to post, get 

 all the engagement, and ride the wave before it’s saturated. Here’s how to stay 

 ahead: 

 Google Trends 

 This free tool shows you what’s gaining popularity right now. 

 https://trends.google.com/ 

 How to use it: 

 Using Google Trends to find viral content for your Facebook page is 

 straightforward. 

 Head to the "Trending Now" section, set it to the U.S. for the past 48 hours, and 

 browse "All trends" or a category like Business and Finance. 

 Look for topics with big search spikes like 20K+ searches, and check if they’re 

 still active. see what’s driving the buzz, then twist those ideas into posts that 
eck if they’re 

 still active. see what’s driving the buzz, then twist those ideas into posts that 

 match your page’s vibe. 

 Refresh it daily, like this morning at 07:34 AM EDT, to catch the latest waves 

 and keep your audience hooked. 

 TikTok Trends 

 Even if you're not posting on TikTok, it's one of the best trends- spotting tools. 

 How to use it: 

 Go to TikTok’s Discover or Search page 

 Search for hashtags in your niche (like #homehacks, #budgetmeals, 

 #fitnessjourney) 

 Pro Tip: 

 If a topic is popping off on TikTok or starting to trend on Google, jump on it 

 immediately for Facebook. Most page owners won’t see it coming. 

 

 Spying tools 

 

 These tools will help you to find viral content for your page, they help you spot 

 what went viral or what’s actually trending on social media right now so you 

 can curate it, create similar pieces of content and post them on your page. 

 For Facebook Only 

 1. Strevio.com 
create similar pieces of content and post them on your page. 

 For Facebook Only 

 1. Strevio.com 

 This tool does the job. It's solid for spying on Facebook competitors and for 

 scheduling, especially if you want to auto-add a link in the first comment to 

 your site for extra cash from display ads. 

 Spying is free, and as I said previously, you can track up to 75 pages and see 

 their viral posts. 

 If you want to skip manual searches for viral trends and want one tool for all 

 platforms, where you can spy and find what’s trending on TikTok, Facebook, 

 YouTube, X, and more, try this: 

 1. Buzzsumo.com 

 Another option to find viral content. It covers Facebook, YouTube, X, and 

 TikTok. 

 It's paid, with no free spying beyond the trial. 

 4. Fanpagekarma.com 

 This is a paid one as well, it does pretty much the same as Buzzsumo, but 

 covers more platforms. 

 So you might be wondering which one I use. 
h the same as Buzzsumo, but 

 covers more platforms. 

 So you might be wondering which one I use. 

 The answer is: I only use Strevio. 

 I stick to Strevio for spying on evergreen content that already went viral. 

 For scheduling, I use Facebook's built-in tool. It gets the job done and it's more 

 than enough. 

 Here's why. 

 Trendy content is not something you can predict and therefore make content 

 about it and schedule it. 

 You need to spot it trending and immediately make content around it and post 

 it. 

 If you don't want to do trending content, Strevio is more than enough. 

 So I only schedule evergreen content that went viral for others after curating it 

 or creating similar content to it. 

 But if you want to do just trends, go ahead and use one the of the spying tools 

 as well.
