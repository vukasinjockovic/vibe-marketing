# Functional Axes for Non-Fiction Analysis

This reference adapts the six-axis functional analysis framework (from dna-extraction) for non-fiction concept analysis. Use these axes to understand not just WHAT a concept says, but what it DOES.

## Core Principle

**The value of a concept is in its function, not just its content.**

A concept like "trust enables collaboration" isn't just a statement to record - it serves multiple functions in the book's argument, the reader's understanding, and the broader knowledge domain.

## The Six Axes (Adapted for Non-Fiction)

| Axis | Question | What It Reveals |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Form** | How is it presented? | The surface articulation (adaptable to other forms) |
| **Structural Function** | How does it support the argument? | Role in the book's logical structure |
| **Application Function** | How can it be used? | Practical utility for the reader |
| **Emotional Function** | What response does it create? | Motivation, conviction, resonance |
| **Thematic Function** | What ideas does it connect to? | Broader intellectual context |
| **Relational Function** | How does it connect to other concepts? | Web of relationships within the domain |

---

## Axis 1: Form

**Question:** How is this concept presented?

The surface articulation - the specific words, examples, and framing the author uses. This is what we directly extract and cite.

**What to Capture:**
- Exact phrasing used
- Examples given
- Analogies or metaphors
- Visual representations (if any)
- The author's specific terminology

**Why It Matters:**
- Preserves the author's voice
- Enables accurate citation
- May reveal author's perspective or bias
- Different forms suit different audiences

**Example:**
- Form: "Trust is the glue that holds communities together"
- Note: Metaphor-based presentation; emphasizes cohesion function

**Form vs. Function:**
The form is "glue metaphor." The function is "explains why trust matters for community cohesion."

---

## Axis 2: Structural Function

**Question:** How does this concept support the book's argument?

The role this concept plays in the book's overall logical structure. Is it a premise? A conclusion? Evidence? A transition?

**Structural Roles:**
- **Foundation:** Premises the argument rests on
- **Pillar:** Major supporting points
- **Evidence:** Data or examples backing claims
- **Synthesis:** Conclusions drawn from earlier points
- **Bridge:** Transitions between major sections
- **Counterpoint:** Anticipated objections and responses

**What to Capture:**
- Where this concept appears in the book's structure
- What it supports or enables
- What depends on it
- How it connects to the thesis

**Example:**
- Concept: "Communities form around shared identity"
- Structural Function: Foundation - this is a premise that subsequent chapters build on

**Why It Matters:**
- Helps understand what's load-bearing vs. decorative
- Enables reconstruction of the book's argument
- Shows what would break if this concept were removed

---

## Axis 3: Application Function

**Question:** How can this concept be used by the reader?

The practical utility - what actions, decisions, or understanding this enables.

**Application Types:**
- **Diagnostic:** Helps identify problems or states
- **Prescriptive:** Guides specific actions
- **Evaluative:** Provides criteria for judgment
- **Predictive:** Enables forecasting outcomes
- **Explanatory:** Helps understand phenomena
- **Generative:** Enables creation of new things

**What to Capture:**
- What someone could DO with this knowledge
- What decisions it informs
- What problems it helps solve
- What capabilities it enables

**Example:**
- Concept: "Communities need shared rituals"
- Application Function: Prescriptive (guides action) + Diagnostic (explains why some communities fail)

**Why It Matters:**
- Determines the concept's practical value
- Helps readers apply knowledge
- Identifies actionable vs. theoretical concepts

---

## Axis 4: Emotional Function

**Question:** What response does this concept create in readers?

The motivational or affective dimension - how this concept makes readers feel and why that matters.

**Emotional Functions:**
- **Validates:** Confirms reader's existing beliefs/experiences
- **Challenges:** Disrupts assumptions, creates productive discomfort
- **Inspires:** Motivates action or aspiration
- **Reassures:** Reduces anxiety about complexity
- **Clarifies:** Relief of understanding something confusing
- **Connects:** Creates sense of shared understanding

**What to Capture:**
- What emotional state the author seems to want to create
- How examples and framing contribute to emotional response
- Whether the concept is meant to comfort or challenge

**Example:**
- Concept: "Most community-building advice is backwards"
- Emotional Function: Challenges (disrupts), then Clarifies (the correction provides relief)

**Why It Matters:**
- Emotional resonance affects retention and application
- Helps understand why certain concepts "stick"
- Reveals author's rhetorical strategy

---

## Axis 5: Thematic Function

**Question:** What broader ideas does this concept connect to?

The intellectual context - how this concept fits into larger conversations, fields, and themes.

**Thematic Connections:**
- **Field placement:** Where does this fit in the discipline?
- **Historical context:** What intellectual tradition is this part of?
- **Adjacent themes:** What other big ideas does this relate to?
- **Debates:** What ongoing conversations does this engage?
- **Paradigms:** What worldview does this assume or challenge?

**What to Capture:**
- What larger themes this concept exemplifies
- What intellectual traditions it draws from
- How it relates to debates in the field
- What assumptions it makes about the world

**Example:**
- Concept: "Community membership is performative, not given"
- Thematic Function: Connects to social constructionism, performance theory, identity politics debates

**Why It Matters:**
- Enables cross-book synthesis
- Reveals intellectual lineage
- Helps position concept in broader knowledge

---

## Axis 6: Relational Function

**Question:** How does this concept connect to other concepts?

The web of relationships - how concepts interact, support, contradict, or build on each other.

**Relational Types:**
- **Prerequisite:** What must be understood first?
- **Enables:** What other concepts does this make possible?
- **Conflicts:** What concepts does this tension with?
- **Exemplifies:** What higher-level concepts does this demonstrate?
- **Decomposes:** What sub-concepts does this break into?
- **Parallels:** What concepts in other domains are similar?

**What to Capture:**
- Direct relationships mentioned by author
- Implicit relationships from proximity or structure
- Cross-book relationships
- Relationships to concepts from other domains

**Example:**
- Concept: "Trust requires competence AND character"
- Relational Function: Decomposes into two sub-concepts; contradicts "trust is just about likability"; enables "specific trust-building tactics"

**Why It Matters:**
- Builds the knowledge network
- Enables navigation and discovery
- Supports synthesis across sources

## Applying the Six Axes

### When to Use Full Six-Axis Analysis

Use full analysis for:
- Key concepts central to the book's argument
- Novel or surprising concepts
- Concepts that will be used in synthesis

Use abbreviated analysis for:
- Supporting examples
- Well-established concepts
- Highly specific implementations

### Six-Axis Template

For each significant concept:

```
**Concept:** [Name or phrase]
**Citation:** [Exact quote with position]

**Axes:**
1. Form: [How it's presented]
2. Structural: [Role in argument]
3. Application: [How it can be used]
4. Emotional: [What response it creates]
5. Thematic: [What ideas it connects to]
6. Relational: [How it connects to other concepts]
```

### Example: Complete Six-Axis Extraction

**Concept:** "The community lifecycle follows a pattern of formation, growth, maturation, and renewal"

**Citation:** "Every community... goes through predictable stages..." (p. 45, chars 12340-12520)

**Axes:**
1. **Form:** Four-stage cyclical model, explicitly named stages, biological metaphor
2. **Structural:** Framework that organizes Part II of the book; each chapter addresses one stage
3. **Application:** Diagnostic (identify which stage you're in); Prescriptive (different tactics per stage)
4. **Emotional:** Reassures (stages are normal); Validates (explains past community experiences)
5. **Thematic:** Connects to lifecycle thinking in business, product management, organizational development
6. **Relational:**
   - Prerequisite: "Communities exist" (basic definition)
   - Enables: Stage-specific tactics (Chapters 5-8)
   - Parallels: Product lifecycle, organizational development stages
   - Decomposes: Four sub-concepts (formation, growth, maturation, renewal)

## Integration with Concept Classification

The six axes complement type and layer classification:

| Classification | Six-Axis Addition |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Type (principle/mechanism/pattern/strategy/tactic) | What kind of concept |
| Layer (0-4) | How abstract/concrete |
| Six Axes | What the concept DOES |

A complete concept record includes:
- Type classification
- Layer assignment
- Full citation with position
- Six-axis functional analysis (for key concepts)
- Relationship links

---

## When Six-Axis Analysis Adds Value

**High Value:**
- Cross-book synthesis (understanding what each concept does enables better comparison)
- Concept retrieval (functional annotations improve search)
- Application planning (knowing application function helps implementation)

**Lower Value:**
- Simple concept extraction (full analysis is overkill for minor points)
- High-volume extraction (time-consuming for every concept)
- Well-known concepts (don't need to analyze "trust is important")

**Recommendation:** Apply full six-axis analysis to ~20% of extracted concepts (the most important ones). Use abbreviated analysis for the rest.
