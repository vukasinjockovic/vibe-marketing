# Concept Types

This reference defines the five concept types used in ebook analysis. Use these definitions to guide classification - they are guidance for judgment, not rigid rules.

## The Five Types

### Principle
**Definition:** A foundational truth, axiom, or universal claim about how things work.

**Distinguishing Features:**
- Asserts something IS true (not how to do something)
- Often stated as timeless or universal
- Serves as foundation for other concepts
- Usually abstract and broadly applicable

**Language Signals:**
- "X is essential for Y"
- "The fundamental truth is..."
- "At its core, X requires Y"
- Declarative statements about nature of things

**Examples:**
- "Communities form around shared identity" (community building)
- "Trust is earned through consistent action" (leadership)
- "Complex systems exhibit emergent behavior" (systems thinking)

**Not Principles:**
- Step-by-step processes (those are tactics)
- Frameworks with multiple components (those are patterns)
- Recommendations for action (those are strategies)

---

### Mechanism
**Definition:** An explanation of HOW something works - the causal chain or process by which effects occur.

**Distinguishing Features:**
- Explains causation (A leads to B because...)
- Describes internal workings
- Can be observed or tested
- Shows the "gears" behind outcomes

**Language Signals:**
- "X works by..."
- "The way this happens is..."
- "When A occurs, B follows because..."
- "The underlying process involves..."

**Examples:**
- "Reciprocity creates social bonds by triggering obligation responses" (social dynamics)
- "Spaced repetition enhances memory by strengthening neural pathways during recall" (learning)
- "Network effects increase value as more users join because each new connection adds multiple potential relationships" (technology)

**Not Mechanisms:**
- Simple observations without explanation (those may be principles)
- How-to instructions (those are tactics)
- Descriptions of what something is (those may be patterns)

---

### Pattern
**Definition:** A recurring structure, framework, or recognizable arrangement that appears across multiple instances.

**Distinguishing Features:**
- Describes a shape or structure
- Can be observed in multiple contexts
- Has named components or phases
- Provides a mental model or framework

**Language Signals:**
- "The X pattern involves..."
- "This follows a common structure of..."
- "The framework consists of..."
- "There are N stages/phases/components..."

**Examples:**
- "The hero's journey pattern: departure, initiation, return" (storytelling)
- "The community lifecycle: founding, growth, maturation, renewal" (communities)
- "The five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance" (psychology)

**Not Patterns:**
- Single actions or techniques (those are tactics)
- Explanations of why things work (those are mechanisms)
- Recommendations without structure (those are strategies)

---

### Strategy
**Definition:** A high-level approach or orientation for achieving goals - the "how to think about" rather than "how to do."

**Distinguishing Features:**
- Provides direction without specifying exact steps
- Can be implemented in multiple ways
- Involves trade-offs and priorities
- Guides decision-making

**Language Signals:**
- "The approach should be..."
- "Focus on X before Y"
- "Prioritize..."
- "The key is to..."
- "Rather than X, consider Y"

**Examples:**
- "Build trust before asking for contribution" (community building)
- "Fail fast and iterate" (product development)
- "Invest in relationships during good times" (leadership)

**Not Strategies:**
- Specific techniques (those are tactics)
- Frameworks with defined components (those are patterns)
- Explanations of why things work (those are mechanisms)

---

### Tactic
**Definition:** A specific, actionable technique or practice that can be directly implemented.

**Distinguishing Features:**
- Concrete and specific
- Can be done immediately
- Has clear success criteria
- Often includes tools, templates, or scripts

**Language Signals:**
- "Do X"
- "Send/Create/Write/Build..."
- "Use the following template..."
- "Every day, do..."
- Imperative verbs

**Examples:**
- "Send welcome emails within 24 hours of signup" (community building)
- "Use the STAR format for behavioral interviews" (hiring)
- "Write three things you're grateful for each morning" (wellbeing)

**Not Tactics:**
- General approaches (those are strategies)
- Explanations of why (those are mechanisms)
- Broad truths (those are principles)

## Classification Decision Tree

When classifying a concept, ask:

1. **Is it an actionable instruction?**
   - Yes → Probably TACTIC
   - No → Continue

2. **Does it explain HOW something causes an effect?**
   - Yes → Probably MECHANISM
   - No → Continue

3. **Does it describe a recurring structure or framework?**
   - Yes → Probably PATTERN
   - No → Continue

4. **Does it provide high-level guidance for achieving goals?**
   - Yes → Probably STRATEGY
   - No → Continue

5. **Does it assert a foundational truth about how things work?**
   - Yes → Probably PRINCIPLE
   - No → Review - may need more context or may be too vague to extract

## Boundary Cases

### Principle vs Mechanism
- Principle: "Trust is essential for collaboration"
- Mechanism: "Trust enables collaboration by reducing transaction costs"
- The mechanism explains WHY the principle is true

### Mechanism vs Pattern
- Mechanism: "Feedback loops amplify small changes"
- Pattern: "The growth-plateau-renewal cycle"
- Patterns describe structure; mechanisms explain causation

### Strategy vs Tactic
- Strategy: "Prioritize quality over quantity"
- Tactic: "Review each post before publishing using this checklist"
- If you can do it in one sitting, it's probably a tactic

### Pattern vs Principle
- Pattern: "The five stages of team development"
- Principle: "Teams require psychological safety to perform"
- Patterns have structure; principles are singular claims

## When Classification is Unclear

If a concept doesn't clearly fit one type:

1. Consider the author's apparent intent
2. Look at surrounding context for clues
3. Choose the type that best serves retrieval
4. Note uncertainty in the concept record
5. Flag for human review if needed

It's better to classify with noted uncertainty than to skip extraction of a valuable concept.
