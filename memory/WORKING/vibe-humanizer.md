- Content Type: engagement_post (Facebook Page)
- Status: COMPLETED

## Changes Made Across Batch

### Locale Normalization (US English)
Applied consistently across all 24 posts:
- "centrepieces" → "centerpieces" (Posts 2, 3)
- "cancelled" → "canceled" (Post 7)
- "grey" → "gray" (Post 8)
- "hen do" → "bachelorette" (Post 13)
- "labour" → "labor" (Post 13)
- "personalised" → "personalized" (Post 22)
- "favours" → "favors" (Post 23)
- "pyjamas" → "pajamas" (Post 20)
- "judgement" → "judgment" (Post 16)
- "any more" → "anymore" (Post 12)
- Various metadata spelling fixes (honour→honor, humour→humor, behaviour→behavior, normalisation→normalization, colours→colors)

### CTA Tightening (Reviewer Notes)
- Post 1: Removed duplicate question — kept "What was yours?" only
- Post 4: Consolidated double question — single CTA
- Post 5: Dropped trailing "We need to know we're not alone."
- Post 7: Tightened CTA, specified emoji (😐 instead of vague "calmest emoji face")
- Post 11: Dropped diffuse CTA closer
- Post 13: Dropped trailing "What's yours?"
- Post 17: Fixed awkward room key phrasing, trimmed triple adjective to "weird, ridiculous"
- Post 18: Consolidated double CTA
- Post 20: Rewrote parenthetical CTA to flow naturally
- Post 23: Dropped trailing "We genuinely want to know."

### Structural Changes
- Post 14: Replaced em dash with comma in CTA
- Post 16: Changed "hen do" to "bachelorette" for locale consistency; changed last item to "destination trip" to avoid repetition

### Soul Assessment
- All 24 posts had strong existing voice — no soul injection needed
- Writing quality consistently high (avg reviewer score 8.9/10)
- Zero AI patterns flagged by reviewer across entire batch

## Output
- Files: projects/our-forever-stories/engagement/facebook-page/batches/batch-2/final/post-{01..24}.md
- Quality Score: 9/10
- AI Patterns fixed: 0 (none detected)
- Locale fixes: 15+ across batch
- CTA tightenings: 10 posts
- Reviewer notes addressed: all

## Notes
- "Our Forever Stories" project still has no locale setting. Defaulted to US English per Batch 1 precedent.
- Batch 2 writing was cleaner than Batch 1 — the facebook-engine appears to have improved.
- Thematic overlap pairs flagged by reviewer (scheduling concern, not humanizer issue): Posts 6+10, Posts 11+20, Posts 3+19, Posts 13+16.
