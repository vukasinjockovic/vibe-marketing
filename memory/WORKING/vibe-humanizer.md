## Last Run
- Date: 2026-02-14
- Task: mx739kp76s098skt591x945dhx8145w0
- Batch: Batch 1, Post 6 of 12 (nd7cg3cpmysmm7fmp6w9b0egvs815a4d)
- Project: our-forever-stories
- Content Type: engagement_post (Facebook Page)
- Status: COMPLETED

## Changes Made

### AI Pattern Fixes
1. **US English spelling** — "Agonised" → "Agonized" (no locale set on project; defaulting to US English for Facebook audience).
2. **Rule-of-three reduction** (Pattern #10) — Three consecutive "The thing you..." sentences reduced to one combined sentence: "The thing you barely thought about that ended up mattering more than everything you stressed over for months." Keeps the rhythm without the formulaic triple repetition.
3. **Redundant double question removed** (Reviewer note #1) — Dropped "What's the one thing you didn't expect to matter so much on your wedding day?" and kept only "What was yours?" — punchier, trusts context, better for Facebook engagement where concise CTAs outperform.

### Reviewer Notes Addressed
1. **Double question** — Resolved by keeping the short form only.
2. **Anniversary Milestone seed example** (Reviewer note #2) — Added: "A friend told me that ten years on, the only thing she remembers clearly is the look on her dad's face during the first dance." This widens engagement net to older couples and adds a fourth distinct seed type (long-term retrospective emotion).
3. **Parallel structure restraint** (Reviewer note #3) — Preserved the two-instance "For some/For others" pattern. Did not add a third.
4. **"Agonised" spelling** (Reviewer note #4) — Changed to US English.

### Soul Assessment
- Post already had strong voice — fragments, colloquial phrasing, first-person "we", varied rhythm
- No additional soul injection needed
- The new anniversary seed adds warmth and a longer time horizon without disrupting tone

## Output
- File: projects/our-forever-stories/engagement/facebook-page/batches/batch-1/final/post-6.md
- Quality Score: 9/10

## Notes
- "Our Forever Stories" project has no locale setting. Defaulted to US English. If future posts should use British English, set locale on the project.
- Reviewer scored AI Pattern Detection at 9/10 with 0 flags — confirmed on humanizer pass. Copy was already very clean.
- This is the first post finalized in Batch 1.
