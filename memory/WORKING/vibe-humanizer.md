## Changes Made

### AI Pattern Fixes
1. **Title case -> sentence case** -- All H2/H3 headings converted to sentence case per Pattern #16.
2. **Boldface reduction** -- Removed mechanical bolding from: grocery list item names (chicken thighs, ground turkey, etc.), "Best for:" tags across tiers, numbered items in "Why Most Plans Fail", supplement names (whey, creatine, vitamin D), inline macro breakdowns. Kept bold only for table totals and CTA link text.
3. **Inline-header bold lists** (Pattern #15) -- Converted grocery list from "**Item** -- description" format to flowing prose: "Chicken thighs (fattier than breast, tastier, more calories for bulking), ground turkey, eggs..."
4. **Em dash reduction** (Pattern #13) -- Replaced ~8 em dashes with commas, colons, or periods. Remaining em dashes kept only where natural pause rhythm warranted.
5. **"Best for:" structural repetition** (reviewer note + Pattern #15) -- Varied tier closing formats: Tier 1 uses descriptive phrase about use cases, Tier 2 uses conversational summary, Tier 3 uses direct suggestion, Tier 4 uses restatement of the one-sentence principle.
6. **Table header variation** -- Changed "Best For" column to "When to use" in summary table.
7. **Arrow CTA removal** -- Removed "Get the ... ->" arrow convention from closing CTA (common AI pattern).

### Reviewer Notes Addressed
1. **External citations** -- Added ISSN 2017 position stand on creatine (500+ studies). Added JISSN 2019 meta-analysis on meal frequency in FAQ section.
2. **Social proof quote** -- Added "I've been lifting for two years and still look the same" reader-voice callout after sample meal plan days, framed as common feedback from program starters.
3. **Micro-commitment prompt** -- Added after 4-tier summary table: "Here's your starting point: pick one Tier 1 meal and one Tier 2 meal from the lists above. That's tomorrow's baseline." Activates Cialdini commitment principle.
4. **FG3 social eating anxiety** -- Added Voss tactical empathy opener to restaurant section: "If you've ever felt a knot in your stomach when coworkers suggest going out for lunch, not from hunger but from anxiety about 'ruining your diet,' read this section twice."

### Soul Additions
1. **Grocery section personal voice** -- Added first-person intro: "I used to overthink grocery shopping. Specialty stores, ingredients I'd use once, half the fridge going bad by Thursday..."
2. **Varied tier closings** -- Each tier ends differently instead of uniform "Best for:" structure.
3. **Closing CTA rewrite** -- Replaced "Stop overthinking your meals. Start eating for the body you're building." with "You've got the strategy. The program is the done-for-you shortcut." (less imperative-pair pattern).
