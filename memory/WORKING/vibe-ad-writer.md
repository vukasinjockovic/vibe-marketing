- Applied Schwartz awareness routing per focus group (Solution Aware, Product Aware, Problem Aware)
- Applied Hormozi DR-24/25/26 (Callout + Value + CTA structure, callout methods, What-Who-When angles)
- Applied Ogilvy headline rules (benefit-first, specifics, brand name, flag audience)
- Included creative direction notes for vibe-image-director, A/B testing priorities, budget allocation

## Output Location
- `projects/gymzilla-tribe/campaigns/.../assets/ads/ad-copy-set_mx72nf8b3ty539mx68cy49ck3d811dcw.md`

## Key Decisions
- Split ads by focus group to test which segment performs best
- Article URL (/lean-bulk-meal-plan-busy-people) for top-of-funnel; product URL for mid/bottom-funnel
- FG1 (hardgainers): Solution Aware → lead with desire/solution ("Can't Gain Weight?")
- FG2 (time-crunched): Product Aware → lead with enlarged claim ("3 Hrs/Week", "56 Days Planned")
- FG3 (flexible seekers): Problem Aware → lead with need/solution ("Strict Diets Fail Because...")
- Retargeting ads target article readers who didn't visit product page
- Budget suggestion: $100/day split 35% Google Search, 40% Meta Feed, 15% Stories, 10% Retargeting
