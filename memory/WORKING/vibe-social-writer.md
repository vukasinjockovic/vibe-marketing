## Content Strategy
- Thread covers the full lean bulk framework: surplus calc → macros → training split → meal tiers → tracking
- Standalone posts hit each focus group:
  - FG1 (Hardgainers): "eat so much but can't gain weight" myth-bust, dirty bulk contrast, DYEL hook
  - FG2 (Time-Crunched): 3-hour/week sufficiency proof, weekly check-in protocol
  - FG3 (Flexible Lifestyle): 80/20 approach, no-Tupperware permission
  - Mixed: Overnight oats hack, polls, question hooks
- Scheduling cadence: 1-2 posts/day over 8 days

## Skills Applied
- L1: Schwartz awareness routing per focus group (solution_aware, product_aware, problem_aware)
- L2: Hormozi offers (value equation framing in thread)
- L3: Cialdini authority (research citations), social_proof (comparison data), commitment (micro-steps)
- L3: Voss tactical empathy (validating time constraints, diet failures)
- L4: Halbert direct response (punchy sentences, specific numbers, no fluff)
- L5: Humanizer pass (no AI patterns, varied sentence length, real voice)
