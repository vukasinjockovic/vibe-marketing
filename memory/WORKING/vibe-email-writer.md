## Sequence Summary
| Email | Name | Day | Awareness Stage |
|-------|------|-----|-----------------|
| 1 | The Math Problem | 0 (immediate) | Solution Aware |
| 2 | The 3-Day Argument | 2 | Solution → Product Aware |
| 3 | The Meal Prep Lie | 4 | Problem → Solution Aware |
| 4 | The Fear | 7 | Problem Aware (fear) |
| 5 | The Decision | 10 | Product → Most Aware |

## Refinements in This Run
- Enhanced Email 4 with stronger Voss tactical empathy (added "It seems like" labeling, "It sounds like" pattern)
- Tightened Email 3 language ("fragility" → "brittle system" framing)
- Added Voss loss-framing to skill map documentation
- Added Objection Handling Map to sequence architecture notes
- Added Awareness Stage labels to each email's metadata

## Skills Applied
- L1: Schwartz awareness staging (mixed audience progression)
- L2: Hormozi Value Equation (Email 5 — stacking all 4 value drivers)
- L3: Cialdini (authority, social proof, liking, commitment)
- L3: Voss (tactical empathy in Email 4, loss framing in Email 5)
- L4: Halbert (A-pile, specific numbers, invisible craft)
- L5: Writing clearly + humanizer (inline)

## Quality Checks
- Awareness match: PASS (each email targets specific stage, progression is logical)
- Single CTA: PASS (one primary action per email)
- Proof density: PASS (specific numbers: 2,850 cal, 170g protein, 60-70% lean mass, 56 days; Schoenfeld meta-analysis; controlled surplus studies)
- AI pattern free: PASS (no "in today's", "let's dive in", "it's important to note", etc.)
