## Key Batch-Level Notes for Humanizer
1. **Locale consistency**: Mix of British ("centrepieces," "hen do," "honour") and American spelling. Standardise to ONE locale.
2. **Thematic overlap pairs** to separate in scheduling:
   - Posts #6 and #10 (quiet love — share same source story details)
   - Posts #11 and #20 (post-Valentine's reality checks)
   - Posts #3 and #19 (non-traditional wedding validation)
   - Posts #13 and #16 (bridesmaid financial burden)
3. **Double CTAs**: Posts 1, 4, 7, 18 end with two questions — humanizer may tighten.
4. **Zero AI patterns detected** across all 24 posts.
5. **Strongest posts**: #12 (9.5), #6 (9.4), #5 (9.3), #10 (9.3)
