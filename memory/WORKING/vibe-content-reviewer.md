## Optional Improvement Notes (for humanizer reference)
1. Tighten double question at end — "What was yours?" alone may be stronger than both questions
2. Consider locale: "Agonised" is British spelling — check project locale setting
3. Could add one seed example from Anniversary Milestone perspective for wider audience reach
4. Preserve the restraint of two "For X it was..." examples — don't add a third
