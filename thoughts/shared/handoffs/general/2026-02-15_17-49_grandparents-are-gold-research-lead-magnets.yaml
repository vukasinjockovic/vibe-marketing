blockers: []

questions:
  - "User noted children's products from Etsy list are relevant AFTER wedding/honeymoon in the lifecycle funnel — need to expand that section"
  - "Should campaign pipelines use single-task model like engagement batches? (from previous session)"
  - "Need to decide product stack: what physical products to offer first (canvas prints, photo books, printable bundles?)"

decisions:
  - dual_audience_strategy: "Both pages serve different life stages of the SAME funnel: young couples (OFS) → parents → grandparents (GAG). Cross-page content works for both"
  - stepps_minimum_threshold: "Only ship lead magnets scoring 21+/30 on Berger STEPPS diagnostic. Below 16 = rework. 16-20 = publishable but won't spread"
  - facebook_primary_for_grandparents: "Facebook is PRIMARY platform for grandparents (74% of 50-64), NOT Pinterest-first like wedding niche"
  - grandparent_engagement_style: "Low-friction prompts work best (one-word comments, share a photo, fill-in-the-blank). Grandparents won't write 200-word stories but WILL share photos and write 1-2 sentences"
  - recurring_series_as_triggers: "Weekly series (Brag Board Friday, Recipe Monday, Wisdom Wednesday, Sunday Memory) create Berger-level daily triggers"

findings:
  - publisher_white_space: "Only 0.16% of 20,726 premium ad-network publishers (Mediavine+Raptive) serve grandparent/senior niche. Zero dedicated grandparent-grandchild activity sites, zero senior printable sites, zero memory preservation sites"
  - grandparent_economy: "$238B annual grandparent spending, 70M+ US grandparents, boomers control 73% of US wealth ($78.1T)"
  - loneliness_is_the_driver: "40% of US adults 45+ are lonely (AARP 2025). Every product that succeeds with this audience works because it says 'You are not forgotten'"
  - nuclear_lead_magnet: "Grandparent Wedding Photo post scored 28/30 STEPPS — crosses BOTH pages (OFS+GAG), creates multi-tag family chain reaction, old photos as inherent remarkability"
  - email_best_channel: "55-64 year olds have HIGHEST email open rate (25.7%) of any age group"
  - etsy_digital_products: "16 of 30 top-selling Etsy digital product categories match OFS niche. Top: wall art printables, wedding templates, photo presets, digital planners"
  - lifecycle_funnel: "User identified the full funnel: engagement → wedding → honeymoon → baby → growing family → grandparents. Children's products fit post-wedding phase"

worked:
  - "Parallel research agents (4 agents simultaneously) gathered comprehensive data in ~5 minutes"
  - "Splitting large document generation across 2 agents (part 1 + part 2) avoids 32K token output limit"
  - "STEPPS scoring framework provides objective quality gate for lead magnets before production"
  - "Reading mbook-berger-contagious SKILL.md gave complete framework for scoring"

failed:
  - "Single agent trying to write all 20 focus groups hit max_output_tokens (32K) — always split large docs"
  - "Old agent (a4de48a) recovered from crash but then got overwritten by new agent (a324558) writing to same file — use different filenames for parallel agents targeting same output"

next:
  - "EXPAND ETSY CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS: User noted children's stuff from Etsy list is relevant in the funnel AFTER wedding/honeymoon. Expand etsy-digital-products-research.md with baby/kids/family lifecycle products"
  - "BUILD PRINTABLE PDFs: Create the actual lead magnet PDFs using HTML/CSS→Puppeteer→PDF pipeline. Priority order in lead-magnets-research-1.md for each page"
  - "CREATE LEAD MAGNETS FOR GAG: Same Etsy digital products research needed for Grandparents Are Gold (senior-specific printables, memory books, recipe journals)"
  - "FACEBOOK PAGE SETUP: Both pages need actual Facebook presence, content calendar, and Messenger automation for DM flows"
  - "EMAIL SEQUENCES: Design post-lead-magnet email nurture sequences for both pages, STEPPS-scored"
  - "WEBSITE FOUNDATION: Need ad-monetized websites for both niches to capture traffic arbitrage revenue. Mediavine Journey requires 1K sessions minimum"
