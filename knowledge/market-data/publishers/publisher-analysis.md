# Publisher Analysis: Grandparent / Senior / Elderly Niche
Generated: 2026-02-15
Source data: 20,726 publishers (8,841 Mediavine + 11,957 Raptive)

## Executive Summary

After systematically searching 20,726 premium ad-network publishers (Mediavine and Raptive) across 8 niche categories, we identified **55 core relevant sites** and an additional **15+ adjacent sites** that serve the grandparent/senior/elderly audience.

**Key finding: This is a thin niche in premium ad networks.** Only ~0.3% of all Mediavine/Raptive publishers explicitly target seniors, grandparents, or retirees. The grandparent-specific sub-niche is especially sparse with only 10-15 true grandparent-focused sites. This represents a significant **content gap and opportunity** -- the audience exists (73M+ US grandparents, 56M Americans 65+) but few premium content publishers serve them.

**No caregiving/assisted living sites** were found in either network, despite this being a massive market. This is a notable white space.

## Key Gaps / White Space Opportunities

1. **Caregiving content**: Only 1 site (dailycaring.com) in 20,726 publishers. Massive underserved market ($500B+ US caregiving economy).

2. **Grandparent-grandchild activities**: No premium publisher focuses on activities, gifts, or experiences specifically for grandparent-grandchild bonding.

3. **Senior printables/puzzles**: While general puzzle sites exist, NONE target seniors specifically. "Large print crosswords for seniors" or "brain games for grandparents" is completely vacant.

4. **Photo gifts / memory keeping for seniors**: Zero sites focused on helping grandparents create or preserve memories through photo books, memory albums, or digital legacy.

5. **Grandparent gift guides**: No dedicated site for gifts to/from grandparents.

6. **Senior technology help**: No premium publisher dedicated to teaching seniors technology (despite this being a massive pain point).

7. **Grandparent travel**: No site specifically for grandparent + grandchild trips ("grandtravel" type content).

8. **Estate/legacy planning for families**: Financial planning specifically for multigenerational wealth transfer.

## Competitive Landscape Summary

The grandparent/senior niche in premium ad networks is **remarkably thin**:

- **Only 34 Tier 1 sites** out of 20,726 total publishers (0.16%)
- **Only 10 sites** directly use "grandma/grandpa/granny" in their domain
- **Only 3 sites** (sixtyandme.com, primewomen.com, grownandflown.com) appear to be significant media properties
- **Zero dedicated grandparent-grandchild activity/gift sites**
- **Zero senior-specific printable/puzzle sites**
- **Zero photo gift or memory preservation sites targeting seniors**

This confirms a massive content gap. A well-executed site in this niche joining Mediavine or Raptive would face minimal direct competition for ad inventory, while serving one of the wealthiest and fastest-growing demographics in the US.
