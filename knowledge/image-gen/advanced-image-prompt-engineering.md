# Advanced Prompt Engineering Guidelines for Al Image & Video Generation

Al image and video generation tools like Midjourney, DALL E, Krea, Higgsfield, Runway, and Veo have opened new creative possibilities for artists, designers, and content creators. However, achieving high-quality, consistent, and commercially usable outputs requires more than just basic prompting.

This guide presents 20 advanced prompt engineering techniques tailored for image and video generation, helping you craft prompts that maximize quality, coherence, and creative control. Each section includes a detailed explanation and a placeholder for a relevant screenshot, along with instructions for exactly what to capture from your Al tool's interface.

## 1. Be Specific with Visual Elements

A vague prompt like 'a futuristic city' may give you random results, while a specific one such as 'ultra-detailed futuristic Tokyo skyline at dusk, glowing neon signs in Japanese, wet reflective streets, cinematic lighting, 85mm lens, photorealistic' produces a targeted, controlled image.

Specificity directs the Al's creative process and minimizes unwanted randomness.

## 2. Describe the Scene Composition

Defining the scene's composition ensures that important elements are placed correctly.

For example, 'wide shot of a lone samurai standing on a cliff edge, ocean waves crashing below, dramatic clouds overhead' tells the Al where to place the subject, background, and secondary elements.

This prevents awkward or illogical placements.

> **Good Prompting:** Ultra-realistic cinematic fashion campaign photograph of a tall Asian female model in her early 20s with long black wavy hair, sharp jawline, and a confident gare, wearing a sleek black satin süp dress with thin straps, gold hoop earrings, and black stiletto heels, standing at a crosswalk in Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing at dusk with blurred neon signs and bustling crowds in the background, illuminated by soft diffused golden-hour light mixed with vibrant neon reflections, captured with an 85mm lens at shallow depth of field from a slightly low angle with natural bokeh, evoking a confident, high-end.

> **Bad Prompting:** Make me a model in a nice outfit in the city.

## 3. Control Lighting and Atmosphere

Lighting changes the mood dramatically.

Instead of simply saying 'portrait of a woman,' specify 'soft diffused window light casting gentle shadows, warm golden hour tones' for a serene look or 'harsh top light creating deep dramatic shadows' for a moody effect.

Lighting cues guide the Al toward cinematic realism.

## 4. Specify Camera Type and Lens

Referencing photography terminology like 'shot on 50mm lens' or 'aerial drone view' informs the Al about framing and perspective.

This produces results that mimic real-world optics, adding depth and realism to the image or video.

## 5. Use Time and Weather for Mood

The time of day and weather conditions can transform a scene's feel.

'Rainy neon-lit Tokyo at night' creates a different atmosphere than 'sunny clear morning in Kyoto'.

Leveraging these details makes outputs more emotionally engaging.

## 6. Incorporate Style References

Referencing specific art styles, famous photographers, or cinematic references can anchor the Al's visual direction.

For example, 'in the style of Gregory Crewdson' or 'Wes Anderson color palette' guides color, composition, and overall tone.

## 7. Define Material and Texture Details

Texture makes images believable.

Adding 'soft velvet fabric,' 'rough stone pavement,' or 'smooth chrome surface' ensures tactile realism in generated outputs.

Al responds strongly to material descriptors.

## 8. Add Motion Cues for Video

For video generation, include movement details like 'slow cinematic tracking shot,' 'handheld shaky cam,' or 'smooth drone flyover'.

Motion cues help Al tools generate more dynamic and intentional animations.

## 9. Specify Subject Pose and Expression

When generating humans or characters, define pose and facial expression to avoid awkward results.

For example, 'woman leaning casually against a wall, soft smile, looking off-camera' gives far better results than just 'portrait of a woman'.

## 10. Set Color Palette Intentions

Color sets emotional tone.

'Muted earthy tones with soft highlights' produces a different mood than 'high-saturation pop colors'.

Explicitly controlling palette prevents unexpected clashing tones.

## 11. Combine Multiple Descriptors Strategically

Balance key descriptors: subject, environment, style, lighting, mood.

For example: 'Cyberpunk alleyway, lone figure with glowing umbrella, cinematic rain, teal-orange color grading, shot on 35mm lens'.

Strategic layering ensures cohesive results.

## 12. Leverage Negative Prompting

Tell the Al what to avoid: 'no text, no watermark, no blurry elements'.

Negative prompts help eliminate unwanted artifacts and irrelevant details.

## 13. Anchor in Real-World References

Mention real-world locations, objects, or cultural elements.

'Santorini cliffs at sunset' or '1967 Ford Mustang' anchors the Al in familiar, recognizable details for authenticity.

## 14. Consider Depth and Foreground Elements

Including foreground interest like 'wildflowers in front of the lens' adds depth and immersion.

Al-generated scenes feel more cinematic when layers are present.

## 15. Match Output Aspect Ratio to Intent

Choosing the correct aspect ratio impacts framing.

A 16:9 ratio suits cinematic video, while 1:1 works better for Instagram.

Specify aspect ratio early to avoid awkward cropping.

## 16. Use Storytelling in Prompts

Describe a moment in a narrative, not just objects.

Instead of 'a knight in armor,' say 'battle-worn knight kneeling under a stormy sky after a long fight, sword planted in the ground'.

Storytelling drives emotional impact.

## 17. Reference Technical Specs for Video

When using video tools, include frame rate, resolution, or cinematic grading preferences.

'4K 24fps cinematic slow-motion with natural film grain' will steer the Al toward professional-grade output.

## 18. Experiment and Iterate

Even advanced prompts can be improved.

Test variations, tweak styles, and refine based on results.

Iteration is key to mastering prompt craft.

## 19. Maintain a Prompt Library for Reuse

Save successful prompts for future adaptation.

A personal prompt library speeds up workflow and ensures consistency across projects.
