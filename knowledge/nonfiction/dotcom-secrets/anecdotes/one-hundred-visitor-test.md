# The One Hundred Visitor Test
**Source:** DotCom Secrets, Secret #13 (Russell Brunson, 2015)
**Type:** Anecdote | **Layer:** 2

## The Experiment
Brunson sent 100 visitors to a $197 product page. Result: 1% conversion = 1 buyer = $197 revenue, 1 new customer.

Then he splintered off the best part of the product as a free-plus-shipping offer and upsold the $197 product afterward.

## Results
- 8% of visitors bought the free-plus-shipping offer (vs. 1% before)
- 25% of those buyers took the $197 upsell
- Revenue per 100 visitors: $394 (doubled)
- New customers per 100 visitors: 8 (8x more)

## Why It Works
"Once you get someone to say the first yes, it's so much easier to get the second yes." The free-plus-shipping offer requires pulling out a credit card (qualifying as buyer) while the word "free" removes psychological resistance. With the card already out and commitment made, the upsell conversion rate is dramatically higher.

## The Order Form Bump Discovery
Adding a $37 checkbox offer on the order form (after credit card info, before submit) got ~34% take rate. Combined with 3x more buyers from free-plus-shipping, this produced nearly identical frontend revenue to the original $197 page while generating 3x more customers flowing into the upsell path.
