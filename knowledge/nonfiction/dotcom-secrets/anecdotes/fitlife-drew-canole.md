## Story
Drew Canole built FitLife.tv to 1.2 million Facebook followers. After Facebook algorithm changes, his traffic dropped 90%. He was spending $116 to sell a $97 product -- losing money on every sale. Drew's team called Brunson for help with "traffic and conversions."

## Diagnosis
The problem wasn't traffic or conversions. "It rarely is." The real problem was that FitLife.tv had no Value Ladder. They brought people in but had nowhere for them to go. "People wanted to give them money, but there was no clear path for them to follow."

## Solution
Restructured the funnel so that instead of making $97 per sale, the business could make 2-3x per sale. This allowed them to afford more ad spend, outbid competitors, and buy traffic from more sources -- all while becoming exponentially more profitable.

## Teaching Point
Illustrates the book's central thesis: low traffic and weak conversions are symptoms of a funnel problem. Fix the funnel, and you can spend more to acquire customers, which solves the traffic problem.
