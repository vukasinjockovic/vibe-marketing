# The Dentist Value Ladder

## Story
Brunson had no dental insurance for years. When his company finally got benefits, he received a postcard for a free teeth cleaning. During the cleaning, the dentist noticed his teeth were yellowing and offered custom whitening trays. Then the dentist noticed his bottom teeth were shifting and offered retainers. Brunson walked in for a free cleaning and walked out paying over $2,000.

## The Value Ladder in Action
1. Free teeth cleaning (bait)
2. Teeth whitening trays (upsell based on identified need)
3. Retainers (second upsell based on another identified need)
4. Cosmetic surgery (backend -- available if needed)
5. Six-month continuity appointments (recurring)

## Teaching Point
Each step provided genuine value, making the customer naturally want to ascend. The dentist didn't hard-sell -- he identified real problems and offered real solutions, each more valuable than the last.
