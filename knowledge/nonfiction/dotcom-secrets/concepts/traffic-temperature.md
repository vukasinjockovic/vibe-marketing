# Traffic Temperature

**Type:** Concept | **Layer:** 1

## Definition
All traffic falls into three temperature categories based on the prospect's relationship with you and awareness of your product. Each temperature requires different messaging, different pre-frame bridges, and often different landing pages.

## The Three Temperatures

### Hot Traffic
- **Who:** People who already know you -- email subscribers, podcast listeners, blog readers, existing customers
- **Communication:** Personality-driven, like talking to friends. Seinfeld-style emails work perfectly.
- **Pre-frame bridge:** Short -- a quick email or blog post with a link
- **Copy approach:** Product-aware -- lead with product name, features, offers
- **Funnel position:** Can enter at any level of the Value Ladder

### Warm Traffic
- **Who:** People who don't know you but have a relationship with someone who does (JV partners, affiliates)
- **Communication:** Endorsement-based -- borrow credibility from the list owner
- **Pre-frame bridge:** Moderate -- JV email endorsement, "lift letter," or partner testimonial
- **Copy approach:** Solution-aware -- lead with the desire/solution, then introduce your product
- **Funnel position:** Frontend or middle of Value Ladder

### Cold Traffic
- **Who:** Strangers with no idea who you are -- found via Facebook ads, PPC, banner ads, SEO
- **Communication:** Education-first -- use general language they understand, avoid jargon
- **Pre-frame bridge:** Longest -- quiz, article, presell page, blog post, bridge page
- **Copy approach:** Problem-aware -- lead with the problem, then introduce the solution, then the product
- **Funnel position:** Frontend only (must earn trust before ascending)

## Gene Schwartz Connection (cited by Brunson)
"If your prospect is aware of your product and has realized it can satisfy his desire, your headline starts with the product. If he is not aware of your product, but only of the desire itself, your headline starts with the desire. If he is not yet aware of what he really seeks, but is concerned with the general problem, your headline starts with the problem and crystallizes it into a specific need."

## The Holy Grail
"If you really want to scale your business, you have to learn how to convert cold traffic. Most people I know just can't do this." Converting cold traffic is the key to seven-, eight-, and nine-figure businesses.
