# The Stack
**Source:** DotCom Secrets, Funnel #4 -- Perfect Webinar (Russell Brunson, 2015)
**Type:** Concept/Mechanism | **Layer:** 3
**Originated from:** Armand Morin

## Definition
A closing technique where you build your offer progressively on a single slide, adding each component one at a time and re-listing all previous components each time. The prospect's final impression is the COMPLETE offer stacked together, not just the last bonus mentioned.

## The Problem It Solves
"The only thing your prospect remembers when you sell is the last thing you showed him." In a traditional pitch, the last thing shown is the final bonus -- if the prospect doesn't value that bonus, they won't buy. The Stack ensures the last thing shown is the FULL offer.

## How It Works
1. Introduce component #1, discuss it, show Stack Slide with 1 item
2. Introduce component #2, show Stack Slide with items 1 + 2: "So you're getting ___ AND ___"
3. Introduce component #3, show Stack Slide with items 1 + 2 + 3
4. Continue until all components are listed
5. Show final Stack Slide with EVERYTHING listed
6. Anchor total value
7. Use If/All statements (toward pleasure + away from pain)
8. Reveal actual price (much lower than stacked value)

## Results
Brunson went from closing 5-10% of a room to consistently closing 20% or more after adopting The Stack. "I will never give a sales presentation again without it."

## If/All Statements
After the full stack: "If all this did was give you the house of your dreams, would it be worth it?" (toward pleasure) "If all this did was let you fire your boss, would it be worth it?" (away from pain)
