# The Pre-Frame

## Definition
The state of mind you place someone in as they enter the next step of your sales funnel. Each step in a funnel is a pre-frame for the next step. "The frame people enter your website through is probably the most important thing you can know." (Mark Joyner via Brunson)

## Core Insight
Not all clicks are created equal. Where a click comes from and what the visitor experienced before arriving at your page matters more than the page itself.

## MIT Study (cited from "Sway" by Brafman)
70 economics students received identical bios of a substitute professor -- except half said "very warm person" and half said "rather cold." After the same lecture, the "warm" group loved him; the "cold" group described him as "self-centered, formal, irritable, and ruthless." One phrase changed the entire experience.

## Pre-Frame Bridge Types
- **Hot traffic:** Short -- direct email link, blog post, podcast mention
- **Warm traffic:** Moderate -- JV email endorsement, lift letter from list owner
- **Cold traffic:** Long -- quiz, article, presell page, blog post, YouTube testimonial, bridge page with education

## Pre-Frame Tactics
1. **Introduction video** for speaking events (Tony Robbins endorsement + success stories)
2. **Quizzes** that agitate the problem before the offer
3. **Articles on third-party sites** that serve as case studies
4. **Blog posts** on trusted influencer sites
5. **YouTube testimonials** that link to the product
6. **Presell pages** that educate before the sales page
7. **News-style formatting** for credibility
8. **Email endorsements** from JV partners (lift letters)

## The Consequence of Bad Pre-Frames
"Consider a person came from a website that said, 'Russell Brunson is a scam artist...' What do you think will happen when he clicks through to see the product?" vs. a site that says "Russell is an amazing person... changed my business and my life." Same landing page, dramatically different conversion rates.
