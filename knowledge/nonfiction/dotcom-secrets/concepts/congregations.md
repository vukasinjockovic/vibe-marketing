# Congregations

**Type:** Concept | **Layer:** 1

## Definition
Groups of people who gather together online based on similar beliefs, values, interests, or problems. The Internet made it possible for niche groups to congregate globally -- forums, Facebook groups, email newsletters, blogs, subreddits, YouTube channels.

## Why They Matter
"Once you understand the core concept of congregations, driving traffic is incredibly easy." Your dream customers already exist in congregations. Your job is to find them and put your message in front of them.

## Three Questions to Find Congregations
1. **Who is your target market?** (Go beyond demographics -- dig into desires, pains, search behavior)
2. **Where is your target market congregating?** (Forums, groups, newsletters, blogs, podcasts)
3. **How can you get them to leave and check out your page?** (The "Enquirer Interrupt" -- short, punchy, curiosity-driven ads)

## The Gold Vein Metaphor
"Think of the Internet as a huge mountain, and your ideal customer is gold inside that mountain." When you find a little gold (a small congregation), dig deeper -- the vein runs deep. Each profitable congregation can be worth "tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars a month."

## The Enquirer Interrupt
Named after The National Enquirer's checkout-stand headlines. Use strange/unusual images + short punchy headlines to interrupt prospects from what they're currently doing and make them click through to your offer.
