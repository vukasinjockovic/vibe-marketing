# The Value Ladder
**Source:** DotCom Secrets, Secret #2 (Russell Brunson, 2015)
**Type:** Framework | **Layer:** 1

## Definition
A structured sequence of products and services arranged by ascending value and price. Left axis = value provided, bottom axis = price charged. The goal is to lead customers from free/low-cost bait to your highest-value (and highest-priced) offering.

## Structure
1. **Bait** -- Free or free-plus-shipping offer that attracts dream customers
2. **Frontend** -- Low-cost ($7-$97) product that qualifies buyers
3. **Middle** -- Mid-range ($100-$2,000) offering with deeper engagement
4. **Backend** -- High-ticket ($3,000-$100,000+) service providing maximum value
5. **Continuity** -- Recurring monthly/yearly program (the "lifeblood of your business")

## Key Principles
- You cannot build an effective sales funnel without a complete Value Ladder
- Most businesses have only 1-2 pieces; adding the missing pieces creates dramatic expansion
- "There's no end to your Value Ladder" -- there is always a higher level of service to offer
- The deeper your funnel/ladder, the more each customer is worth, the more you can spend to acquire them

## Dentist Example (from the book)
Free teeth cleaning -> Teeth whitening ($hundreds) -> Retainers ($hundreds) -> Cosmetic surgery ($thousands) -> 6-month continuity appointments

## Brunson's Own Value Ladder
Free book (DotComSecrets) -> Home study courses -> Live events -> $10K Ignite -> $25K Inner Circle -> $1M done-for-you consulting

## Connection to Funnels
Each level of the Value Ladder has its own sales funnel:
- Frontend levels use Two-Step or SLO Funnels
- Middle levels use Webinar, Invisible, or Product Launch Funnels
- Backend levels use High-Ticket Three-Step Application Funnels
