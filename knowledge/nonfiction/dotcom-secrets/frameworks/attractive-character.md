# The Attractive Character
**Source:** DotCom Secrets, Secret #6 (Russell Brunson, 2015)
**Type:** Framework | **Layer:** 2

## Definition
A persona that attracts clients, builds following, and drives sales. Not about physical appearance -- about the character you share with your audience. "Creating your Attractive Character can mean the difference between making one thousand dollars a month and one hundred thousand."

## Four Elements
1. **Backstory** -- Origin story that relates to the product. Must show where you came from so prospects can relate. Without it, you're "just a dude eating subs."
2. **Parables** -- Teaching stories from the AC's life that illustrate principles. More powerful than facts. "When you stop teaching facts and start teaching through parables, your messages will stay with an audience longer."
3. **Character Flaws** -- Vulnerabilities and imperfections. "No one wants to hear about the perfect person." Makes you relatable (Superman + Kryptonite).
4. **Polarity** -- Taking a stand on hard matters. Splits audience into fans/neutrals/haters. "Being neutral is boring." Creates raving fans who buy repeatedly.

## Four Identities
1. **The Leader** -- Has achieved the result, leads audience on same path. Most common.
2. **The Adventurer/Crusader** -- Goes on journeys, brings back treasures and answers.
3. **The Reporter/Evangelist** -- Interviews experts, shares discoveries. Best for entering a new niche. "Becoming a reporter is a great way to start a business in a niche you don't know much about."
4. **The Reluctant Hero** -- Humble, shares secrets out of moral duty. Brunson's personal identity.

## Six Storylines
1. **Loss and Redemption** -- "I had everything... then ___ happened... it turned out to be a blessing..."
2. **Us vs. Them** -- Polarize audience, create rallying cry. "Talkers vs. do-ers."
3. **Before and After** -- Transformation stories. "First I was ___. Now I'm ___."
4. **Amazing Discovery** -- "Oh my gosh, wait til you hear about this thing I just discovered!"
5. **Secret Telling** -- "I've got a secret... if you want to find out, you need to ___."
6. **Third-Person Testimonial** -- Other people's success stories as social proof.

## Key Insight
The AC does not have to be YOU. It can be a client, student, or case study (like Subway's Jared). But a backstory is essential regardless of who plays the role.
