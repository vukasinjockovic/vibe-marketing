# Soap Opera Sequence
**Source:** DotCom Secrets, Secret #7 (Russell Brunson, 2015)
**Type:** Framework | **Layer:** 2
**Originated from:** Andre Chaperon

## Definition
A 5-email auto-responder sequence sent to new subscribers that builds a rapid bond with the Attractive Character using the narrative techniques of soap operas: open-ended drama, cliffhangers, and emotional hooks that pull the reader from one email to the next.

## The 5 Emails

### Email #1: Set the Stage
- Welcome and introduce the AC
- Set expectations for email frequency
- Open a loop: tease what is coming tomorrow
- Example: "Tomorrow I'm going to let you go through one of my BEST products for free"

### Email #2: Open with High Drama
- Start at the point of high drama (NEVER at the beginning of the story)
- Fill in the backstory leading to a wall (where the reader is stuck now)
- Open a new loop -- promise the answer in email #3
- Include a soft CTA (optional product link)

### Email #3: Epiphany
- The moment everything changed for the AC
- Tie the epiphany directly to the product being sold
- Formula: "My epiphany was I needed to ___, and that's when I learned about ___"
- CTA to product

### Email #4: Hidden Benefits
- Unexpected benefits of following the AC's path
- Use parables (stories) to demonstrate hidden benefits
- Show emotional/lifestyle value beyond the obvious
- Stronger CTA with offer details

### Email #5: Urgency and CTA
- Create real urgency (limited seats, expiring offer, pulling video offline)
- "Fake urgency will backfire on you"
- Final strong CTA

## Key Mechanics
- Each email pulls reader to the next via open/close loops
- 1-2 sentences per line, lots of white space
- Personality over perfection -- grammatical errors are acceptable
- These are auto-responder emails (set and forget, sent in sequence)
- After completing, subscribers move to daily Seinfeld emails (broadcasts)

## The Loop Technique
Open a story loop = create anticipation for the next email
Close the loop in the next email = deliver on the promise
Simultaneously open a NEW loop = maintain the chain

"I'm sure you've seen directors do this on soap operas or reality shows. The tactic pulls you from commercial break to commercial break."
