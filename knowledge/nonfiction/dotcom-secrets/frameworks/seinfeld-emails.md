# Daily Seinfeld Email Sequence
**Source:** DotCom Secrets, Secret #8 (Russell Brunson, 2015)
**Type:** Framework | **Layer:** 2

## Definition
Daily broadcast emails sent after the Soap Opera Sequence completes. Named after the TV show "about nothing" -- these are entertaining, personality-driven emails about everyday life that always tie back to a product or offer.

## Formula
- **90% entertainment, 10% content**
- Pick a story/observation from the AC's daily life
- Make it entertaining and personal
- Tie it back to a specific product with a CTA
- Send DAILY

## Topic Ideas (from the book)
- What's going on in the AC's life?
- What happened that's embarrassing?
- How are you getting through the holiday season?
- Where are you planning your vacation this year?
- What did you buy recently that you regret?
- What did you buy recently that you adore?
- What made you scream with rage yesterday?
- What crazy antics did your kid or dog get into?
- What funny thing from your past teaches a lesson?

## Critical Rule
"EVERY EMAIL and each story must be tied back into some type of offer for your audience. If you just send out entertaining emails and don't tie in your products or services, you won't make a dime."

## Key Differences from Soap Opera
- Seinfeld emails are BROADCASTS (sent to entire list on a given day)
- Soap Opera emails are AUTO-RESPONDERS (sent in sequence after opt-in)
- Seinfeld emails are not in a fixed sequence -- they are topical/timely
- Can be written ahead and scheduled, but typically tied to current events in AC's life

## Frequency Evidence
"I used to email once a month, and my response rates were horrible. So then I started emailing twice a month. And guess what? I more than doubled my income." Progression: monthly -> bimonthly -> weekly -> every other day -> daily. "If I don't email my list every day, I lose money every day."

## Double Duty
Copy-paste Seinfeld emails to your blog for content. "People often ask me what they should write about on their blogs, and I always tell them simply to copy and paste their daily Seinfeld email."
