# The Seven Core Funnels
**Source:** DotCom Secrets, Section 4 (Russell Brunson, 2015)
**Type:** Framework | **Layer:** 2-3

## Frontend Funnels (cold/warm traffic, $0-$97)

### Funnel #1: Two-Step, Free-Plus-Shipping
- Page 1: Video (Who/What/Why/How script) + two-step form
  - Step 1: Shipping address (captures email)
  - Step 2: Credit card for shipping
- Order form bump (~$37 product, ~34% take rate)
- OTO page(s) using OTO script
- Psychology: lower barrier = 8x more buyers; commitment escalation

### Funnel #2: Self-Liquidating Offer (SLO)
- Squeeze page (free lead magnet for email)
- SLO page: video or long-form sales letter (Star/Story/Solution script, 44 steps)
- Price range: $27-$97
- Goal: frontend covers ad costs; upsells = pure profit
- Order form bump + OTO sequence

### Funnel #3: Continuity
- Simple funnel: email sequence -> continuity offer page
- Best used as SECOND funnel (after customer bonds with AC via Soap Opera)
- If free/$1 trial: use Who/What/Why/How script
- If no trial: use Star/Story/Solution script
- Effective upsells: yearly or lifetime accounts

## Middle-of-Ladder Funnels (warm traffic, $100-$2,000)

### Funnel #4: The Perfect Webinar
- Registration page (Who/What/Why/How script)
- Confirmation page (date/time)
- Webinar: Introduction (5 min) + Content -- 3 Secrets (50-60 min) + The Stack close (10-20 min)
- Automated version: tracks when participants leave, sends different email sequences accordingly
- "Both [automated webinars] have made me over a million dollars"

### Funnel #5: Invisible Funnel Webinar
- Registration with credit card (NOT billed yet)
- 3-4 hour premium webinar with best content
- After webinar: charge card unless they email to cancel
- Soft sell to high-ticket coaching application at end
- Registration uses Magic Bullet script
- Typical: 85% attendance, 90% pay, + six figures from backend applications

### Funnel #6: Product Launch
- 4 videos released over several days
- V1: "Wow and How" (big idea + case studies)
- V2: "Transformational Education" (walk through process)
- V3: "Ownership Experience" (future pace + imagine)
- V4: "The Offer" (what you get + how to order)
- Best with warm/hot traffic (email list or JV partners)
- Made famous by Jeff Walker

## Backend Funnel (hot traffic, $3,000+)

### Funnel #7: High-Ticket, Three-Step Application
- Step 1: Case study video + "Apply Now" button
- Step 2: Application form (prospect sells YOU on why they're a fit)
- Step 3: Homework page (3 pre-frame videos)
- Phone: Two-person script (Setter gathers emotions/goals, Closer gets commitments and closes)
- "We can literally make as many sales with just two sales people as we could with sixty"
