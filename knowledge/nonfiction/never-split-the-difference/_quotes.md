## On Empathy and Understanding

> "Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow."

> "Emotions aren't the obstacles, they are the means."

> "Empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. It's about understanding them. Empathy helps us learn the position the enemy is in."

> "Without a deep understanding of human psychology, without the acceptance that we are all crazy, irrational, impulsive, emotionally driven animals, all the raw intelligence and mathematical logic in the world is little help."

## On Listening and Mirroring

> "We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar. Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation."

> "Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said."

> "Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making."

## On Labeling and Naming Emotions

> "Labels almost always begin with roughly the same words: It seems like... It sounds like... It looks like..."

> "The word 'I' gets people's guard up. When you say 'I,' it says you're more interested in yourself than the other person."

> "The last rule of labeling is silence. Once you've thrown out a label, be quiet and listen."

## On the Power of "No"

> "It comes down to the deep and universal human need for autonomy. People need to feel in control. When you preserve a person's autonomy by clearly giving them permission to say 'No' to your ideas, the emotions calm."

> "Pushing hard for 'Yes' doesn't get a negotiator any closer to a win; it just angers the other side."

> "You provoke a 'No' with this one-sentence email. Have you given up on this project?"

> "If you're trying to sell something, don't start with 'Do you have a few minutes to talk?' Instead ask, 'Is now a bad time to talk?'"

## On "That's Right" vs "You're Right"

> "'That's right' is better than 'yes.' Strive for it. Reaching 'that's right' in a negotiation creates breakthroughs."

> "'You're right' is the worst answer... Tell people 'you're right' and they get a happy smile on their face and leave you alone for at least twenty-four hours. But you haven't agreed to their position."

> "Use a summary to trigger a 'that's right.' The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing."

## On Loss, Fairness, and Bending Reality

> "People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain."

> "To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through."

> "The most powerful word in negotiations is 'Fair.'"

> "We don't compromise because it's right; we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face."

> "While we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is governed by emotion."

## On Calibrated Questions and Control

> "The secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control."

> "Calibrated questions avoid verbs or words like 'can,' 'is,' 'are,' 'do,' or 'does.' Instead, they start with 'who,' 'what,' 'when,' 'where,' 'why,' and 'how.'"

> "'How am I supposed to do that?' became our primary response to a kidnapper demanding a ransom. And we never had it backfire."

> "'Why' can backfire. Regardless of what language the word 'why' is translated into, it's accusatory."

## On Implementation and Commitment

> "'Yes' is nothing without 'How.' While an agreement is nice, a contract is better, and a signed check is best."

> "The Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation."

> "When you push for implementation and they say, 'I'll try,' you should get a sinking feeling in your stomach. Because this really means, 'I plan to fail.'"

> "If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable."

## On Bargaining and Negotiation Tactics

> "When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight."

> "The Golden Rule... has a big flaw. The other side might not want to be treated the way you want to be treated."

> "We've found that you can usually express 'No' four times before actually saying the word."

> "Humanize yourself. Use your name to introduce yourself. Say it in a fun, friendly way."

## On Black Swans and Hidden Information

> "I began to hypothesize that in every negotiation each side is in possession of at least three Black Swans, three pieces of information that, were they to be discovered by the other side, would change everything."

> "Let what you know -- your known knowns -- guide you but not blind you. Every case is new."

> "Threats can be like nuclear bombs. There will be a toxic residue that will be difficult to clean up."

## On the Core Philosophy

> "He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation."

> "Negotiation is not an act of battle; it's a process of discovery."

> "Life is negotiation."
