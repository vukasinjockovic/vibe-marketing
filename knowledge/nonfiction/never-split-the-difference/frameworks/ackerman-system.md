## Summary
The Ackerman Bargaining System is a systematic offer-counteroffer method used for haggling. It has a strict 6-step formula: (1) Set your target price (your goal), (2) Set your first offer at 65% of target, (3) Calculate three raises of decreasing increments to 85%, 95%, and 100%, (4) Use empathy and different ways of saying "No" to get the other side to counter before you increase, (5) Use precise nonround numbers on the final amount (e.g., $37,893 not $38,000), (6) On the final number, throw in a nonmonetary item the other side probably doesn't want to signal you're at your limit. The decreasing increments make the counterpart believe they are squeezing you to your absolute limit.

## Key Findings
1. The system uses decreasing increments (65% -> 85% -> 95% -> 100%) to signal that each concession is harder to make, creating the perception the other side is extracting maximum value.

2. Precise, nonround final numbers ($37,893 instead of $38,000) are perceived as more credible because they imply careful calculation rather than arbitrary rounding.

3. The nonmonetary throw-in on the final offer signals you have nothing left to give financially.

4. Between each offer, use empathy (labeling, calibrated questions) and different ways of saying "No" to force the counterpart to bid against themselves.

5. In the Haiti kidnapping case, this system brought a $150,000 ransom demand down to $4,751 plus a portable CD stereo.

## Key Quotes
> "The Ackerman model is an offer-counteroffer method... The systematized and easy-to-remember process has only four steps."

> "When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight."
