**Aliases:** rule of three, triple agreement, three-time verification

## Summary
The Rule of Three is Voss's technique for verifying genuine commitment: get the counterpart to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation using different framings. The first agreement might be a direct statement, the second a summary or label that gets "That's right," and the third a calibrated question like "What do we do if we get off track?" Each agreement tests whether the commitment is real (Commitment Yes) or false (Counterfeit Yes). People who are lying or giving counterfeit agreement find it very hard to maintain the facade through three separate agreement moments.

## Key Findings
1. The Rule of Three simply means getting the other party to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation, using different framings each time.

2. It works because liars have difficulty maintaining consistent false agreement across three differently-framed checkpoints.

3. The three agreements should use different forms: direct statement, summary/label, and calibrated question.

4. This is a guard against "I'll try" energy (which means "I plan to fail") and Counterfeit Yes.
