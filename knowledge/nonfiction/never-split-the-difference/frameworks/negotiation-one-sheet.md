**Aliases:** negotiation one sheet, one-page preparation tool, negotiation prep sheet

## Summary
The Negotiation One Sheet is Voss's preparation framework -- a single-page document completed before any negotiation that forces the negotiator to think through five sections: (I) The Goal (best-case, worst-case, and what you'll ask for), (II) Summary (facts that will trigger "That's right"), (III) Labels/Accusation Audit (3-5 labels to preempt objections), (IV) Calibrated Questions (3-5 "How"/"What" questions to reveal value and behind-the-table dynamics), and (V) Noncash Offers (nonmonetary items of value). It is presented in the book's Appendix as a practical tool synthesizing all techniques.

## Key Findings
1. Section I (The Goal): Think through best and worst outcomes, then set an optimistic but reasonable goal. Write it down.

2. Section II (Summary): Write a summary of facts you know about the counterpart's situation that, when stated, will trigger "That's right."

3. Section III (Labels/Accusation Audit): Prepare 3-5 labels that anticipate the counterpart's fears, concerns, and accusations.

4. Section IV (Calibrated Questions): Pre-write 3-5 calibrated "How"/"What" questions designed to reveal value, uncover deal-killers, and identify behind-the-table influencers.

5. Section V (Noncash Offers): List nonmonetary items that could have value to the counterpart, used as throw-ins or creative solutions.
