**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid

**Aliases:** tactical empathy, emotional intelligence in negotiation

## Summary
Tactical Empathy is Chris Voss's foundational framework for all negotiation. It redefines empathy as not agreement or sympathy but as understanding the feelings and mindset of another person in the moment -- and hearing what is behind those feelings -- so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow. It is the prerequisite for every other technique in the Voss system: mirroring, labeling, accusation audits, and calibrated questions all depend on tactical empathy as their operating system.

## Key Findings
1. Empathy is not about being nice or agreeing. It is about understanding and demonstrating understanding to increase influence.

2. Tactical empathy is the deliberate deployment of empathy as an influence tool, not a passive emotional state.

3. The Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM) places empathy as Stage 2 of a 5-stage progression: Active Listening -> Empathy -> Rapport -> Influence -> Behavioral Change. You cannot skip to influence without earning empathy first.

4. In practice, tactical empathy manifests through specific techniques: mirroring (repeating words), labeling (naming emotions), accusation audits (preempting negatives), and calibrated questions (giving the illusion of control).
