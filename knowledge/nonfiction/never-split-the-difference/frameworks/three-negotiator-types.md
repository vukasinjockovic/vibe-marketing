## Summary
Voss categorizes all negotiators into three personality types, each with a fundamentally different relationship to time and communication: (1) Analysts -- methodical, data-driven, time = preparation, hate surprises, skeptical by default; (2) Accommodators -- relationship-focused, time = relationship-building, sociable, avoid conflict, prone to saying yes without meaning it; (3) Assertives -- results-driven, time = money, direct, need to be heard first before they will listen. The critical insight is that each type's natural communication style is counterproductive with the other types. An Assertive's directness offends an Analyst. An Accommodator's warmth frustrates an Assertive. You must adapt your approach to the counterpart's type, not your own.

## Key Findings
1. Analysts are methodical, diligent, and self-isolating. They hate surprises. They treat time as preparation time. They are skeptical. They need data and time to think.

2. Accommodators are relationship-focused, sociable, and conflict-averse. They treat time as relationship time. Their weakness: they may agree to things they cannot deliver.

3. Assertives treat time as money. They need to be heard before they will listen. They value directness and getting to the point. Mirrors work well with Assertives because every mirror feels like being heard.

4. You must identify the counterpart's type and adapt YOUR style to theirs. Using your own natural style with everyone is a common failure mode.

5. The Golden Rule of negotiation is wrong: treat people the way THEY need to be treated, not the way you want to be treated.

## Key Quotes
> "Some people are Accommodators; others -- like me -- are basically Assertive; and the rest are data-loving Analysts."

> "The Golden Rule... has a big flaw. The other side might not want to be treated the way you want to be treated."
