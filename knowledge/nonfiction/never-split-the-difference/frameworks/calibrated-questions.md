**Aliases:** calibrated questions, open-ended questions, how questions, what questions

## Summary
Calibrated Questions are open-ended questions beginning with "How" or "What" (and occasionally "Why" when defensiveness serves you) designed to give the counterpart the illusion of control while actually directing the conversation. They avoid verbs like "can," "is," "are," "do," or "does" that can be answered with a simple yes or no. The signature calibrated question -- "How am I supposed to do that?" -- became the FBI's primary response to ransom demands and never backfired. Calibrated questions force the counterpart to use their mental energy to solve YOUR problem, making them feel in control while you frame the agenda.

## Key Findings
1. Calibrated questions avoid closed verbs and start with "who," "what," "when," "where," "why," and "how" -- with "what" and "how" being the most useful.

2. "How am I supposed to do that?" became the FBI's primary response to ransom demands and never backfired.

3. "Why" is generally avoided because it is accusatory in any language. The one exception: when you WANT the defensiveness to serve your purpose ("Why would you ever change from the way you've always done things?").

4. Calibrated questions work because they give the illusion of control. The counterpart thinks they are driving the conversation, but you set the frame.

5. Key standby calibrated questions include: "What about this is important to you?", "How can I help to make this better for us?", "How would you like me to proceed?", "What is it that brought us into this situation?", "How can we solve this problem?", "What are we trying to accomplish here?", "How am I supposed to do that?"
