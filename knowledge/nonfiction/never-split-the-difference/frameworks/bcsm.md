# Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM)
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** BCSM, Behavioral Change Stairway, FBI stairway model, five-stage negotiation model

## Summary
The Behavioral Change Stairway Model is the FBI's foundational negotiation framework consisting of five sequential stages: (1) Active Listening, (2) Empathy, (3) Rapport, (4) Influence, (5) Behavioral Change. The critical insight is that you CANNOT skip stages. You must earn each level before attempting the next. Most people (and most sales copy) fail because they jump straight to Stage 4 (Influence) or Stage 5 (Behavioral Change) without first establishing active listening, empathy, and rapport. The model was developed by the FBI's Crisis Negotiation Unit and underpins all of Voss's techniques.

## Key Findings
1. The five stages are strictly sequential: Active Listening -> Empathy -> Rapport -> Influence -> Behavioral Change. Skipping stages causes failure.

2. Most failed negotiations (and most failed copy) attempt influence before establishing empathy and rapport.

3. "That's right" is the signal that you have successfully moved from Empathy through Rapport. It means the counterpart feels deeply understood and is now ready for influence.

4. The model was developed from hostage negotiation but applies to all persuasion contexts.

## Key Quotes
> "The model proposes five stages -- active listening, empathy, rapport, influence, and behavioral change -- that take any negotiator from listening to influencing behavior."

> "'That's right' is better than 'yes.' Strive for it. Reaching 'that's right' in a negotiation creates breakthroughs."
