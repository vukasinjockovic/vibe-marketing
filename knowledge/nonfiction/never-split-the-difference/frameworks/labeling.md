## Summary
Labeling is the technique of verbally acknowledging the other person's emotions using third-person phrasing ("It seems like...", "It sounds like...", "It looks like...") followed by silence. Voss positions it as the primary tool for deploying tactical empathy. The neuroscience behind it: naming a negative emotion activates the rational brain (prefrontal cortex) and reduces amygdala (fear center) activity -- literally defusing the physiological fear response. Labeling positive emotions reinforces them. The critical rule: NEVER use "I" framing ("I think you feel...") because it makes the statement about the speaker and raises the listener's guard.

## Key Findings
1. Labels always begin with: "It seems like...", "It sounds like...", or "It looks like..." Never "I think..." or "I'm hearing that..."

2. The word "I" in a label gets people's guard up because it signals the speaker is more interested in themselves than the listener.

3. After delivering a label, you must use silence. Let it land. Do not fill the pause. The silence is where the work happens.

4. Labeling negative emotions diffuses them; labeling positive emotions reinforces them. Research shows affect labeling activates rational thinking regions and reduces amygdala activity.

5. In the Harlem standoff, Voss used labels through a closed door for 6 hours ("It looks like you don't want to come out. It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we'll come in with guns blazing.") All three armed fugitives surrendered.

## Key Quotes
> "Labels almost always begin with roughly the same words: It seems like... It sounds like... It looks like... Notice we said 'It sounds like...' and not 'I'm hearing that...' That's because the word 'I' gets people's guard up."

> "When people are shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater activity in the amygdala... But when they are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that govern rational thinking."

> "The last rule of labeling is silence. Once you've thrown out a label, be quiet and listen."

- What is the optimal delay (silence duration) after a written label before continuing?
