## Summary
Mirroring is a negotiation technique where you repeat the last one to three critical words (or the most important words) of what someone has just said. In the FBI context, it is a deliberate listening tool -- not the NLP body-language version. Voss codifies it as a 4-step repeatable formula: use the late-night FM DJ voice, start with "I'm sorry...", mirror, then hold silence for at least four seconds. It works by triggering a deep neurological response -- the human need to bond with similar behavior -- causing the counterpart to elaborate, share information, and feel connected.

## Key Findings
1. Mirroring in the Voss system means repeating the last 1-3 critical words of what someone said. It is NOT mimicking body language or NLP mirroring.

2. The technique follows a strict 4-step formula: (1) DJ voice, (2) "I'm sorry...", (3) mirror, (4) silence (4+ seconds). Then repeat.

3. Mirroring works because of isopraxism -- an unconscious neurological tendency to copy each other as a way of signaling we belong together.

4. In the Chase Manhattan Bank robbery case, mirroring extracted critical intelligence: when Voss mirrored "We chased your driver away?", the suspect revealed the existence of an unknown accomplice.

## Key Quotes
> "For the FBI, a 'mirror' is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said."

> "It's just four simple steps: 1. Use the late-night FM DJ voice. 2. Start with 'I'm sorry...' 3. Mirror. 4. Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart. 5. Repeat."

> "Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar."
