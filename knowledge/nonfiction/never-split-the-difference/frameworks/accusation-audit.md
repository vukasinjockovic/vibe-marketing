## Summary
The Accusation Audit is the practice of listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you, your product, or your offer -- and then saying those things first, before they do. It is a preemptive deployment of labeling at scale. By naming the worst-case fears and accusations upfront, you defuse the amygdala response before it activates, making the counterpart less defensive and more open to your actual message. Voss positions this as the critical step before any pitch, request, or ask for commitment.

## Key Findings
1. The first step is listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you -- an "accusation audit."

2. Accusation audits work because they front-load the negative emotions, allowing the listener to process and dismiss fears before encountering the actual request.

3. In practice, the format is: name the worst accusation, name the second worst, name the third worst, then pivot with "And yet..." or "The reality is..."

4. Anna used an accusation audit to save a $1 million contract: "You may feel like we have treated you unfairly... We acknowledge that you believe you were promised this work." The counterpart responded: "You are not the 'Big Bad Prime.'"

5. The technique leverages the principle that denying negatives ("I don't want to sound harsh") actually CONFIRMS them, while naming negatives directly defuses them.

## Key Quotes
> "The first step of doing so is listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you, in what I call an accusation audit."

> "'You're going to think I'm a lousy businessman. You're going to think I can't budget or plan...' And then, once I'd anchored their emotions in a minefield of low expectations, I played on their loss aversion."
