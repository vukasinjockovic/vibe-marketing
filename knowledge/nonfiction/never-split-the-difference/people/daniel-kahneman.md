## Summary
Daniel Kahneman is a Nobel Prize-winning psychologist (Economics, 2002) known for his work on judgment and decision-making with Amos Tversky. In Never Split the Difference, Voss draws heavily on Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory -- particularly Loss Aversion (people take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains) and the Certainty Effect (people prefer sure things over probabilities). These mechanisms provide the scientific backing for Voss's "Bend Their Reality" chapter and his strategic emphasis on loss framing over gain framing.

## Key Findings
1. Prospect Theory: people evaluate outcomes as gains and losses relative to a reference point, not in absolute terms.
   -- Source: Never Split the Difference, Ch.6 (referencing Kahneman & Tversky)

2. Loss Aversion: losses loom larger than equivalent gains, by roughly 2:1.

3. Certainty Effect: people overweight sure things relative to probabilistic outcomes.
