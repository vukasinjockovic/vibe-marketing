## Summary
Abu Sabaya (real name Aldam Tilao) was a commander and spokesperson for the Abu Sayyaf Group, an Islamic militant organization in the southern Philippines. In Never Split the Difference, he is the primary counterpart in the Dos Palmas / Burnham kidnapping case. Voss describes him as a media-savvy, manipulative negotiator who used cell phone calls and media appearances to control the narrative. Abu Sabaya represents the type of counterpart who uses negotiation as a platform and publicity tool rather than genuinely seeking a deal -- requiring the negotiator to manage perception and information asymmetry.

## Key Findings
1. Used media appearances and cell phone calls as negotiation leverage, controlling the public narrative.
