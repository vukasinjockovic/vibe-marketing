## Summary
Jim Camp was a negotiation coach and author of Start with No, a book that influenced Voss's thinking on the power of "No" in negotiation. Camp argued that "No" is the beginning of real negotiation, not the end -- a principle Voss adopted and expanded into his "No"-oriented question framework. Camp represents the bridge between the old Getting to Yes school and Voss's emotionally-grounded approach.

## Key Findings
