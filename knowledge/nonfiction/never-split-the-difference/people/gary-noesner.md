## Summary
Gary Noesner is a former FBI chief hostage negotiator who helped establish the FBI's Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU) and develop the Behavioral Change Stairway Model. He served as Voss's predecessor and mentor in the FBI negotiation world. Noesner represents the generation that transitioned the FBI from a purely tactical (force-first) response to crisis situations toward a negotiation-first approach. His book Stalling for Time covers many of the same cases from a different perspective.
