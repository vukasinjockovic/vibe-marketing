## Summary
Chris Voss is a former FBI lead international kidnapping negotiator who served 24 years in the Bureau, including as the lead negotiator for the FBI's Crisis Negotiation Unit. After retiring, he founded The Black Swan Group, a negotiation consulting firm, and teaches at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, Harvard University, and USC's Marshall School of Business. His approach represents a paradigm shift from the rational-analytical Harvard negotiation model (Getting to Yes) to an emotionally-grounded, tactical empathy-based system derived from real-world hostage negotiation experience.
