## Summary
Robert Mnookin is the Samuel Williston Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and chair of the Program on Negotiation at Harvard. In Never Split the Difference, he serves as the representative of the rational-analytical Harvard negotiation approach (the Getting to Yes tradition). In the opening anecdote, Voss defeats Mnookin in a roleplay negotiation exercise using calibrated questions against Mnookin's BATNA-based approach, establishing the book's thesis that emotional intelligence beats rational analysis in negotiation.

## Key Findings
1. Represents the rational-analytical Harvard negotiation school that Voss's approach challenges.
