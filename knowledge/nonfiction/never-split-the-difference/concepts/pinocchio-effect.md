**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Pinocchio effect, liar detection, verbal deception cues

## Summary
The Pinocchio Effect is Voss's term for the verbal patterns that indicate deception. Research by Harvard Business School's Deepak Malhotra found that liars use more words than truth-tellers (they work harder to convince), use more third-person pronouns (distancing from the lie), and speak in more complex sentences. The name comes from the idea that like Pinocchio's growing nose, liars' language becomes more elaborate and distanced. Voss uses this as a tool for detecting false commitment and Counterfeit Yes responses.

## Key Findings
