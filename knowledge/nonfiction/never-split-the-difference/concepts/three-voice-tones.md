**Aliases:** three voice tones, late-night FM DJ voice, positive playful voice, assertive voice, tone of voice

## Summary
Voss identifies three voice tones available to negotiators, each producing different effects: (1) Late-Night FM DJ Voice -- calm, slow, measured, downward-inflecting. Used for situations requiring authority and de-escalation. Creates an aura of certainty without triggering resistance. (2) Positive/Playful Voice -- light, encouraging, easygoing, the sound of someone smiling. This is the DEFAULT voice for most interactions. (3) Direct/Assertive Voice -- used rarely, as it signals confrontation and triggers push-back. In written copy, these translate to prose styles: short declarative sentences for DJ voice, conversational warmth for positive/playful, and single firm sentences for assertive.

## Key Findings
1. Three tones: Late-Night FM DJ (calm, downward inflection), Positive/Playful (default, smiling), Assertive (rare, confrontational).

2. The Positive/Playful voice should be the default. Most of your time should be spent in this tone.

3. The Late-Night FM DJ voice is deployed selectively for making specific points that need to land with finality.

4. The Assertive voice should be used rarely. When used, it triggers a "paradox of power" where pushing harder creates more resistance.
