# Amygdala Interrupt (Affect Labeling)
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** amygdala interrupt, affect labeling, emotion naming, fear defusing

## Summary
The Amygdala Interrupt is the neuroscience mechanism behind why labeling works. Research shows that when people are shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, brain activity concentrates in the amygdala (the fear center). But when those same people are asked to LABEL the emotion they see, activity shifts from the amygdala to the prefrontal cortex (rational thinking areas). By naming a fear or negative emotion, you literally redirect the counterpart's brain from reactive-emotional processing to rational-analytical processing. This is why accusation audits defuse defensiveness and why labeling fears reduces them.

## Key Findings
1. Naming a negative emotion reduces amygdala activity and increases prefrontal cortex activity (rational thinking).

2. This is why labeling works: it moves the brain from fight-or-flight to analytical processing.

3. The mechanism works even in one-way communication (e.g., Voss labeling through a closed door in the Harlem standoff).

4. Labeling positive emotions reinforces them through a similar mechanism -- conscious acknowledgment amplifies positive states.

## Key Quotes
> "When people are shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater activity in the amygdala... But when they are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that govern rational thinking."

## Open Questions
- Does the amygdala interrupt work the same way when reading (visual processing) vs. hearing (auditory processing)?
- Is there a delay in the effect when labels are read vs. heard?
