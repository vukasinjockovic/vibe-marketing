## Summary
Voss calls "Fair" the most powerful word in negotiation. People will sacrifice rational self-interest to punish perceived unfairness (as demonstrated by the Ultimatum Game research). He identifies three uses of the word "fair" in negotiation: (1) Defensive judo -- "We just want what's fair" (destabilizes the other side, makes them feel like they're being unfair); (2) Nefarious accusation -- "We've given you a fair offer" (manipulative, designed to trigger guilt); (3) Positive/constructive -- "I want you to feel treated fairly at all times. So stop me if anything seems unfair." (builds trust and opens communication). Only the third use is recommended.

## Key Findings
1. "Fair" is the most powerful word in negotiations.

2. Three uses: defensive judo ("We just want what's fair"), nefarious accusation ("We've given you a fair offer"), and positive constructive ("I want you to feel treated fairly").

3. People will reject economically rational offers if they perceive unfairness. The Ultimatum Game shows people reject free money to punish unfairness.

4. The recommended approach is proactive: tell the counterpart upfront that you want them to feel treated fairly and to alert you if anything seems unfair. This disarms the word before it can be weaponized.
