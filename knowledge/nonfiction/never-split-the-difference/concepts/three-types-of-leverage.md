**Aliases:** three types of leverage, positive leverage, negative leverage, normative leverage

## Summary
Voss identifies three taxonomic types of leverage in negotiation: (1) Positive Leverage -- you have something they want and can give or withhold it; (2) Negative Leverage -- you can cause them pain or loss (ability to make the counterpart suffer); (3) Normative Leverage -- you can use the counterpart's own stated standards, beliefs, morals, or norms against them to show inconsistency. Normative leverage is the most subtle and often the most powerful because people have a deep need to be consistent with their stated values. Understanding which leverage you hold determines your negotiation strategy.

## Key Findings
1. Three types at a taxonomic level: Positive, Negative, and Normative.

2. Positive leverage is having what they want. You can give it or withhold it.

3. Negative leverage is the ability to cause pain. Use carefully -- threats are "like nuclear bombs" with toxic residue.

4. Normative leverage uses their own standards against them. If they claim to value fairness, hold them to that standard. If they say they always pay on time, remind them of that commitment.

5. Normative leverage is often the key to discovering and using Black Swans -- understanding the counterpart's "religion" (worldview, values, norms).
