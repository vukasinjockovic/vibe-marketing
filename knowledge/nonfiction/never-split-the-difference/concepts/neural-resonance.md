**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid

**Aliases:** neural resonance, brain alignment, mirrored neural activity

## Summary
Neural Resonance is the neuroscience finding that when two people communicate effectively, their brains literally align -- good listeners can even anticipate what the speaker will say next. Voss cites Princeton University fMRI research showing that neural resonance disappears when people communicate poorly. In the Voss system, this is the scientific backing for mirroring and active listening: by closely observing and reflecting another person's communication, you create brain-to-brain alignment that accelerates trust and understanding. In written copy, the implication is that demonstrating deep understanding of the reader's world creates a similar resonance effect.

## Key Findings
1. When people communicate effectively, their brains align. Good listeners can anticipate what the speaker will say.

2. Neural resonance disappears when communication is poor (fMRI brain-scan research at Princeton).

3. Mirroring and active listening create the conditions for neural resonance to occur.
