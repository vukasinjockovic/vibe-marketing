# "That's Right" vs "You're Right"
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** that's right, you're right, breakthrough moment, dismissal vs agreement

## Summary
Voss draws a critical distinction between two responses that sound similar but mean opposite things. "That's right" is a breakthrough moment -- it means the counterpart feels deeply understood and is now genuinely open to influence. It signals successful progression through the BCSM (Active Listening -> Empathy -> Rapport). "You're right," by contrast, is a dismissal -- it means "go away, I don't want to engage with you anymore." People say "You're right" to end conversations they want to escape. The technique for triggering "That's right" is the Summary: paraphrase the counterpart's situation in their own words + label their underlying emotions.

## Key Findings
1. "That's right" = breakthrough. It means the counterpart feels understood and is ready for influence.

4. Voss tells the story of his son Brandon: when told "you're right, Dad," Voss knew Brandon had zero intention of changing behavior. It was a brush-off.

## Key Quotes
> "'That's right' is better than 'yes.' Strive for it. Reaching 'that's right' in a negotiation creates breakthroughs."

> "'You're right' is the worst answer... Tell people 'you're right' and they get a happy smile on their face and leave you alone for at least twenty-four hours. But you haven't agreed to their position."

> "Use a summary to trigger a 'that's right.' The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing."
