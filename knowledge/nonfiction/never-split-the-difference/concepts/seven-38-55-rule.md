**Aliases:** 7-38-55 rule, Mehrabian rule, communication percentages

## Summary
The 7-38-55 Rule (attributed to Albert Mehrabian) states that only 7% of a message is conveyed through words, 38% through tone of voice, and 55% through body language and facial expressions. Voss uses this principle to emphasize that words alone are insufficient for communication -- tone and nonverbal signals carry 93% of the message. In negotiation, this means paying close attention to HOW things are said (tone, pace, inflection) and what the body is doing, not just the words. For written copy, the implication is stark: you must compensate for the missing 93% through prose style, rhythm, formatting, and emotional labeling.

## Key Findings
1. 7% words, 38% tone of voice, 55% body language/facial expressions.

2. When words and tone/body language are incongruent, people trust the nonverbal signals over the words.

3. This is why the Rule of Three works: if someone agrees verbally but their tone or body language contradicts, the third check will reveal the inconsistency.
