**Aliases:** loss aversion, prospect theory, loss framing, fear of loss

## Summary
Loss Aversion is the psychological principle (from Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory) that people take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve equivalent gains. Voss applies this as a core persuasion mechanism: frame what the counterpart LOSES by not acting, not just what they gain by acting. In the Voss system, loss framing is a strategic tool -- you anchor the counterpart's emotions in what they stand to lose, then position your offer as the way to avoid that loss. The Certainty Effect is a related mechanism: people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is mathematically superior.

## Key Findings
1. People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. This is the foundational insight from Prospect Theory.

2. In negotiation, frame what the counterpart loses by not accepting your offer. Loss framing is more powerful than gain framing.

3. The Certainty Effect: people are drawn to sure things over probabilities. Present your offer as the certain outcome.

4. In practice, Voss uses loss aversion after an accusation audit: anchor emotions low with fears, then show what the counterpart loses by not acting.
