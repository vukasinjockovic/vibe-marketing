**Aliases:** three types of yes, counterfeit yes, confirmation yes, commitment yes

## Summary
Voss identifies three distinct types of "Yes" that people give, only one of which leads to action: (1) Counterfeit Yes -- said to escape, to end the interaction, to buy time, or to avoid confrontation; (2) Confirmation Yes -- reflexive, innocent agreement to a fact or simple question, with no promise of action; (3) Commitment Yes -- a genuine agreement that leads to behavioral change and follow-through. Most sales and negotiation failures come from treating Counterfeit or Confirmation Yes as Commitment Yes. The Rule of Three is designed to distinguish between them.

## Key Findings
1. Three types: Counterfeit (escape), Confirmation (reflexive), Commitment (real agreement leading to action).

2. "Yes is nothing without 'How.'" Agreement without implementation planning is worthless. Always follow yes with "How" questions to test commitment.

3. Pushing for early "Yes" usually produces Counterfeit Yes and triggers defensiveness.

4. The Rule of Three (getting agreement three times in different forms) is specifically designed to catch Counterfeit Yes.
