**Aliases:** Chris discount, name humanization, personal name technique

## Summary
The Chris Discount is Voss's technique of using your own first name in negotiation to humanize yourself and create a personal connection. When you introduce yourself by name and use your name in conversation ("My name is Chris. What's the Chris discount?"), you become a real person rather than an abstract adversary. This triggers reciprocity and makes it psychologically harder for the counterpart to treat you as a faceless opponent. In written copy, the equivalent is signing with a real name, using personal anecdotes, and humanizing the brand voice.

## Key Findings
1. Using your own name humanizes you and makes the counterpart more accommodating.

2. The technique works by activating the counterpart's empathy -- it is harder to be adversarial with a named individual than an anonymous entity.

3. Funny and light-hearted use of your name ("What's the Chris discount?") combines humor with humanization.
