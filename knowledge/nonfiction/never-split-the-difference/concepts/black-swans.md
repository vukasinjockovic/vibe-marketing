# Black Swans (Unknown Unknowns)
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** black swans, unknown unknowns, hidden information

## Summary
In Voss's framework, Black Swans are pieces of information that neither side knows they don't know -- unknown unknowns that, if discovered, would change everything about the negotiation. Voss hypothesizes that every negotiation contains at least three Black Swans per side. The job of the negotiator is to uncover them through deep listening, calibrated questions, and face-to-face interaction. Black Swans explain why negotiations that seem stuck can suddenly break through when a single piece of previously hidden information surfaces. The concept is borrowed from Nassim Taleb but applied specifically to negotiation dynamics.

## Key Findings
1. Every negotiation contains at least three Black Swans per side -- pieces of information that would change everything.

2. Black Swans are uncovered through deep listening, not through logic or preparation alone. They emerge from face-to-face interaction.

3. Three types of leverage relate to Black Swan discovery: Positive (you can give what they want), Negative (you can cause pain), and Normative (you can use their own standards against them).

4. "Know their religion" -- understanding the counterpart's worldview, beliefs, and values is the fastest path to discovering Black Swans.
