**Aliases:** illusion of control, perceived autonomy, giving control

## Summary
The Illusion of Control is the principle that people need to feel they are making their own decisions. When they feel in control, they become more cooperative, not less. The mechanism: ask questions and frame choices that make the counterpart think THEY are driving the conversation, while you are actually setting the frame and direction. This is the operating principle behind calibrated questions -- "How am I supposed to do that?" makes the counterpart feel powerful while forcing them to solve your problem. Voss calls this "the secret to gaining the upper hand."

## Key Findings
1. People need to feel in control. When they do, cooperation increases.

3. The paradox: by giving up apparent control (asking questions instead of making demands), you gain actual control of the conversation's direction.

4. This principle extends to "No"-oriented questions: letting the counterpart say "No" preserves their sense of autonomy and control.
