**Aliases:** William Griffin, Rochester bank siege, Black Swan discovery

## Summary
William Griffin takes hostages in a bank in Rochester, New York. His demands seem irrational -- they don't follow any known negotiation pattern. The breakthrough comes when the FBI discovers the Black Swan: Griffin was planning to be killed by the police (suicide by cop) so his family would receive his life insurance payout. Once this unknown unknown was uncovered, the entire negotiation framework shifted. The case demonstrates Voss's Black Swan theory -- every negotiation contains hidden information that, once discovered, changes everything. What appears irrational becomes perfectly rational once you understand the counterpart's true motivations.

## What It Illustrates
1. Black Swans (unknown unknowns) explain apparently irrational behavior -- once discovered, the behavior makes perfect sense.

2. If the counterpart's behavior seems crazy, you are missing information. Never assume irrationality.

3. Deep listening and curiosity (not logic or force) uncover Black Swans.
