**Aliases:** Anna's contract, Big Bad Prime, accusation audit business case

## Summary
Anna, a student of Voss's, must deliver bad news to a subcontractor (ABC Corp): their team is being cut from 5.5 people to 3 on a government contract. She opens with a full accusation audit: "We understand that we brought you on board with the shared goal of having you lead this work. You may feel like we have treated you unfairly, and I understand what that looks like from your perspective... We acknowledge that you believe you were promised this work." Instead of becoming adversarial, ABC Corp's response is: "You are not the 'Big Bad Prime.'" Anna's company saves $1 million. The case demonstrates that accusation audits transform potentially hostile business conversations into collaborative ones.

## What It Illustrates
1. Accusation audits defuse hostility before it forms -- even when delivering objectively bad news.

2. Naming the counterpart's likely accusations ("you may feel we treated you unfairly") prevents those accusations from taking root.

3. The technique works in business-to-business contexts, not just hostage negotiations.
