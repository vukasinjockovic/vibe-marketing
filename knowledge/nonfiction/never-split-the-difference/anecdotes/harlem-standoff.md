**Aliases:** Harlem standoff, labeling through a door, three fugitives

## Summary
Three armed fugitives barricade themselves in an apartment in Harlem. There is no phone line, no way to establish two-way communication. Voss speaks through the closed door for six hours using nothing but labels: "It looks like you don't want to come out. It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we'll come in with guns blazing. It looks like you don't want to go back to jail." All three surrender peacefully. When asked why they came out, they say: "You calmed us down. We finally believed you wouldn't go away." This case proves that labeling works even in one-way communication -- the same dynamic that applies to written copy.

## What It Illustrates
1. Labeling works in one-way communication -- you do not need a two-way conversation.

2. Naming fears defuses them (amygdala interrupt) even when the speaker cannot see the listener's reaction.

3. Persistence matters: six hours of consistent empathetic labeling built enough trust to surrender.

4. Critical implication for copy: written labels on a page can produce the same calming, trust-building effect.
