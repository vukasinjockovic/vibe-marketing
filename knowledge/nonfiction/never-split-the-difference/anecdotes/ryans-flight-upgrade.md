**Aliases:** Ryan's flight upgrade, gate agent upgrade, technique stack demonstration

## Summary
Ryan, a Voss student, approaches a gate agent (Wendy) after watching an angry couple leave. In under two minutes, he executes a full technique stack: Label ("It seems like they were pretty upset"), Mirror ("The weather?"), Mirror ("Booked solid?"), Label ("It seems like you've been handling the rough day pretty well"). Result: boarding pass to a sold-out flight plus an Economy Plus upgrade. Voss calls this a "riff: Label, tactical empathy, label. And only then a request." The case demonstrates that Voss techniques compose naturally and can produce results in extremely short interactions.

## What It Illustrates
1. Labels and mirrors compose into natural-sounding conversation that produces outsized results.
