**Aliases:** Chase Manhattan robbery, Chris Watts bank robbery, Bobby Goodwin standoff

## Summary
Voss's first real negotiation case. Three bank robbers take hostages at a Chase Manhattan branch in New York. Through mirroring suspect Chris Watts ("We chased your driver away?"), Voss extracts critical intelligence: the existence of an unknown getaway driver, proving there was a fourth accomplice. Later, by using the Late-Night FM DJ voice with Bobby Goodwin, Voss talks him out of the bank peacefully. The case demonstrates mirroring's power to extract information without the subject realizing they are revealing it, and the DJ voice's ability to de-escalate.

## What It Illustrates
1. Mirroring extracts information involuntarily -- Watts revealed a fourth accomplice without meaning to.
