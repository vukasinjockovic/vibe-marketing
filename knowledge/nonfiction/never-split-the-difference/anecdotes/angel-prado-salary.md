**Aliases:** Angel Prado, salary negotiation, full technique stack business case

## Summary
Angel Prado, a Voss student, negotiates his salary using a comprehensive stack of Voss techniques. He uses a nonspecific anchor (mentions tuition money = $31k to set a low reference point), requests a new title (nonmonetary pivot), lets his boss go first with a number ($31k offer), then presents a range from job descriptions ("$134.5k--$143k"), causing his boss to negotiate with himself upward. The boss settles at $134,500 -- a precise nonround number from the range Angel provided. Angel seals it with "That's fair" (constructive fairness framing) and recruits the boss as his mentor. The case demonstrates how multiple Voss techniques compose together in a single business conversation.

## What It Illustrates
1. Ranges anchor the counterpart at the low end of YOUR range (which is still higher than their offer).

2. Nonmonetary pivots (new title, mentorship) add value without increasing the dollar amount at stake.

3. Precise nonround numbers ($134,500) are perceived as more carefully calculated and thus more credible.

4. "That's fair" closes the deal by satisfying both parties' fairness instinct.

5. Recruiting the boss as mentor creates a long-term ally, not just a one-time win.
