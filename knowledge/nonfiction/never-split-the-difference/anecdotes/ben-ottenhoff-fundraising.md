# Ben Ottenhoff Fund-Raising: "No"-Oriented Script
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Ben Ottenhoff, political fundraising, no-oriented fundraising

## Summary
Ben Ottenhoff, a political fund-raiser, rewrites his team's calling script from a "Yes"-oriented pattern to a "No"-oriented pattern. The old script asked "Do you believe gas prices are too high?" (forces yes) followed by a donation request. The new script asked "Do you feel that if things stay the way they are, America's best days are ahead of it?" (invites no, meaning "things are bad") followed by "Are you going to sit and watch without putting up a fight?" (invites no, meaning "I'll fight"). The "No"-oriented script produced a 23% better rate of return. This is the primary business case for "No"-oriented framing in marketing copy.

## What It Illustrates
1. "No"-oriented questions outperform "Yes"-oriented questions by 23% in real-world A/B testing.

2. Questions that invite "No" feel safer and less manipulative to the respondent.

3. The "No" responses ("things aren't good" / "I won't just sit here") actually express the positive commitment the fund-raiser wants.
