# Washington Redskins Collections Script Rewrite
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Redskins collections, TJ script rewrite, season ticket collections

## Summary
TJ, a student of Voss's, rewrites a collections script for delinquent Washington Redskins season ticket holders. The old script was aggressive and seller-centric ("me me me"). The new script shifted to buyer-centric empathetic framing: "YOUR Washington Redskins... the home-field advantage created by you... In these difficult times, we understand our fans have been hit hard." The result: payment plans were arranged with all delinquent holders before the season opener. The case demonstrates that changing copy from seller-centric to buyer-centric with empathetic labeling transforms response rates without changing the actual offer or terms.

## What It Illustrates
1. Buyer-centric copy with empathetic labeling dramatically outperforms seller-centric copy -- same offer, different framing.

2. Labeling the reader's situation ("In these difficult times, we understand our fans have been hit hard") defuses resistance to paying.

3. Ownership language ("YOUR Washington Redskins") activates identity and belonging.
