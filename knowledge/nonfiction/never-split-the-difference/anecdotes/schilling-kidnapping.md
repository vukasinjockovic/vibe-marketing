**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Schilling kidnapping, Jill Carroll case, that's right breakthrough

## Summary
A kidnapping case where the FBI needed to reach the kidnapper through his mother. The breakthrough came when the FBI team got the kidnapper's mother to say "That's right" about her son's situation. By summarizing the mother's fears and concerns (paraphrase + label), they triggered the "That's right" response, which opened the door to genuine cooperation. This case is the primary demonstration of why "That's right" is the breakthrough signal in any negotiation, and why achieving it through the Summary formula (paraphrase + label) is the most reliable path.

## What It Illustrates
1. "That's right" is the breakthrough moment that signals genuine cooperation.
