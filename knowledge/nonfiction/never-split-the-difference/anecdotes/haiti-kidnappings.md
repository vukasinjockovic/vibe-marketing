**Aliases:** Haiti kidnapping, $4751 ransom, extreme anchor case

## Summary
A kidnapping in Haiti with an initial demand of $150,000. Voss deploys the full Ackerman system: extreme low anchor of $3,000, calibrated questions to stall and gather information, fairness framing, decreasing increments of offers, and a precise nonround final number of $4,751 plus a portable CD stereo as the nonmonetary throw-in. The hostage is released safely for roughly 3% of the original demand. This case demonstrates the complete Ackerman Bargaining System in action, plus the power of precise nonround numbers and nonmonetary items to signal you are at your absolute limit.

## What It Illustrates
1. The Ackerman system can produce results far beyond expectations (97% reduction from initial demand).

2. Precise, nonround numbers ($4,751 not $5,000) create the perception of careful calculation and a firm bottom line.

3. Nonmonetary throw-ins (portable CD stereo) signal financial exhaustion and add creative value.

4. Calibrated questions between offers force the counterpart to bid against themselves.
