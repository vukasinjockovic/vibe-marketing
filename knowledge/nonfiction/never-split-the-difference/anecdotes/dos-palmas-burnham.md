**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Dos Palmas, Burnham case, Abu Sayyaf kidnapping, Martin and Gracia Burnham

## Summary
American missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham are kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines (Dos Palmas resort raid). The case involves Abu Sabaya as the primary negotiator on the kidnapper side. Voss discusses this as a case where calibrated questions ("How do I know the hostages are alive?", "How am I supposed to pay if I don't even know they're okay?") were critical for maintaining control in a multi-party, multi-month hostage situation. The case ends tragically with Martin Burnham killed during a rescue attempt, making it one of the most somber cases in the book and a reminder that even the best techniques operate within constraints.

## What It Illustrates
1. Calibrated questions maintain negotiation control across extended timeframes.

2. Multi-party hostage situations (government, military, kidnappers, families) require managing multiple counterparts simultaneously.

3. Negotiation techniques have limits -- external factors (military intervention) can override any negotiation progress.
