**Aliases:** Harvard roleplay, Voss vs Mnookin, Harvard negotiation exercise

## Summary
Chris Voss, an FBI negotiator with no academic credentials, participates in a roleplay exercise at Harvard with professors Robert Mnookin (chair of the Program on Negotiation) and Gabriella Blum. Playing a kidnapper, Mnookin and Blum use rational, BATNA-based approaches. Voss defeats them both by repeatedly asking the calibrated question "How am I supposed to do that?" -- forcing them to solve his problem for him while giving them the illusion of control. Blum recognizes what is happening and warns Mnookin: "Don't let him do that to you." The anecdote opens the book and establishes the central thesis: emotional intelligence techniques beat rational-analytical approaches.
