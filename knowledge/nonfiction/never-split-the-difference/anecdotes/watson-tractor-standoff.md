**Aliases:** Dwight Watson, tractor standoff, National Mall standoff, tobacco farmer

## Summary
Dwight Watson, a tobacco farmer, drives his tractor into a pond on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., claiming to have explosives, protesting government treatment of tobacco farmers. The standoff demonstrates Black Swan principles: Watson's behavior seems irrational until his normative framework (his "religion") is understood -- he genuinely believed the government had wronged tobacco farmers and was willing to die for that belief. Understanding his worldview (normative leverage) was the key to resolving the situation. The case illustrates that "crazy" behavior always has a logic once you understand the counterpart's belief system.

## What It Illustrates
1. Understanding the counterpart's "religion" (deeply held beliefs) is the key to resolving seemingly irrational standoffs.

2. Normative leverage (holding someone to their own values) requires first understanding what those values are.

3. Never assume the counterpart is irrational. Find the Black Swan that explains their behavior.
