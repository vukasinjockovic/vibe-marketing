## Who He Is

Gary Halbert's youngest son. Was turning 16 when the letters were written in 1984. Had been his father's protege since age 9. Published The Boron Letters with added commentary ("UPDATE" sections after each chapter).

## Key Contributions
- Added modern digital marketing translations of his father's principles
- Extended the A-Pile/B-Pile concept to email: "It's Better To Be In The Spam Box of A Primary Email Address Than To Be In The Primary Box of A Spam Email Address"
- Emphasized the "copy dump" method: write start-to-finish in one sitting, then edit many times
- Added the power word list technique: track currently resonant words from tabloid headlines
- Extended the eye-relief concept for online: shorter paragraphs, more white space, use of ellipses
- Co-authored ad breakdowns with brother Kevin at Halbertizing.com

## Key Quote About His Father

> "Many people have said my father could sell ice to Eskimos, and it's meant to be a compliment, but that is the exact opposite of what he preached. Gary Halbert felt the smartest marketers offer all the Eskimos a great deal on heaters!"
