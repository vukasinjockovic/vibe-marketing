# HALT Decision Framework

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapter 20
Author: Gary Halbert

## Core Idea

Never make an important decision when you are:
- **H**ungry
- **A**ngry
- **L**onely
- **T**ired

## What To Do Instead

Write, run, walk, jog, do chores. Physical movement clears the emotional deck so strategic decisions and creative output come from clarity, not reaction.

## Self-Check Methods

1. **Time Guess Test:** Guess the time without looking. If you are off by more than 7 minutes, you are off. Take a walk or do something physical before making any decisions.
2. **Clumsiness Test:** If you are bumping into things or slightly clumsy, you are off.
3. **Vision Test:** Blurred vision = stressed state. Fall back and regroup.

## Bond Halbert's Addition

Wait 72 hours after being emotional before making any important decision. "It is hard to stay emotional for 3 days."
