# The Starving Crowd Framework

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapter 6
Author: Gary Halbert

## Core Idea

If you and a competitor both owned hamburger stands and were in a contest to sell the most hamburgers, the only advantage that matters is a starving crowd. Not better meat, not sesame seed buns, not lower prices, not location.

## Application

Before creating any product or writing any copy, find a market that is demonstrably hungry for what you could sell. Proof of hunger: they are already buying similar things, frequently, recently, and at high price points.

## Decision Rule

1. Look at mailing list sizes in SRDS (or modern equivalents: Amazon bestseller lists, Clickbank, ad libraries)
2. Look for ads that repeat month after month -- repetition = profit
3. Look for high unit-of-sale, high frequency, high recency lists
4. Only AFTER finding the starving crowd do you develop or source a product

## Key Quote

> "The only advantage I want is A STARVING CROWD!"

## Anti-Pattern

Starting with a product you love and then searching for people to buy it. "A guy with a new product cannot always find a hot market for that product but a guy who has uncovered a HOT MARKET can always find a product to fill the needs of that market."
