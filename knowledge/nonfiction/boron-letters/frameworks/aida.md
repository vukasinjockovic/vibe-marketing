## Core Idea

Every sales letter and ad should follow this sequential structure:

### A -- Attention
Grab focused, quality attention with a relevant device. Physical objects attached to letters (dollar bills, coins, baggies of dirt/sand), startling facts, personal details. The grabber MUST tie in naturally with the message.

### I -- Interest
Feed interesting facts. Statistics, specific numbers, surprising data about the opportunity. How much money, how many fish you can catch, how many cubic tons of sand.

### D -- Desire
Help the reader "picture with pleasure" the benefits of owning what you sell. Use sensory word pictures:
- New car (comfort, luxury, impressing friends)
- Nice house (status, comfort)
- Peace of mind (no worrying about bills)
- Vacations (travel the world)
- Attracting the opposite sex
- Leisure time (money buys time)

### A -- Action
Tell them EXACTLY what to do, step by step:
- Tell them where the order coupon is
- Tell them to fill it out
- Tell them to enclose payment
- Tell them how much to send
- Tell them who to make checks payable to
- Tell them to use the envelope
- Tell them to do it RIGHT NOW, TODAY
- Tell them what they GET if they hurry
- Tell them what they LOSE if they delay

Devote up to 25% of total copy to closing.

## Key Quote

> "Tell him what he will get if he hurries and tell him what he will lose if he delays."
