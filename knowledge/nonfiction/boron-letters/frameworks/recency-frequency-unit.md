# Recency, Frequency, Unit of Sale (RFU)

## Core Idea

Three guidelines for evaluating any audience/list quality, in order of importance:

### 1. Recency (Most Important)
The more recently a person purchased something similar, the more receptive they will be. "Hotline buyers" (30-90 day purchasers) are the hottest prospects.

> "Get 'em while they're hot!"

### 2. Frequency
The more often a person buys a particular type of item, the higher their desire. A person who has bought several books on skin diving is more likely to buy another.

### 3. Unit of Sale
A person who recently paid $100 for diet pills is a hotter prospect for diet products than someone who paid $10. Higher spend = higher commitment = higher desire.

## Application

When selecting any audience -- mailing list, ad targeting, email segment -- filter by:
1. Most recent buyers first
2. Then by repeat purchase behavior
3. Then by average order value

## Key Quote

> "People don't always put their money where their mouths are; but they do nearly always put out their money where their true desires are."
