# The A-Pile / B-Pile Framework

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapter 11
Author: Gary Halbert

## Core Idea

Every person sorts their mail (physical or email) into two mental piles:

- **A-Pile:** Looks personal. Letters from friends, relatives, business associates. ALWAYS opened.
- **B-Pile:** Obviously commercial. Bulk mail, teaser copy, company logos, labels. Sometimes opened, often thrown away.

## A-Pile Characteristics
- First-class stamp (not bulk rate indicia)
- Handwritten or typed address (not printed label)
- Plain return address (no company name/logo)
- No teaser copy on envelope
- Personal salutation inside ("Dear Bond")
- Day, date, and time stamp for immediacy
- Describes where the writer is and what they are doing

## B-Pile Characteristics
- Company name and logo on corner card
- Bulk rate permit number
- Cheshire label
- Teaser copy ("WOW! Exciting News Inside!")
- "Dear Occupant" or "Dear Friend" salutation

## Digital Translation (Bond Halbert's Update)

People now sort by email address:
- **A-Pile email:** Personal and work addresses they check daily
- **B-Pile email:** Spam/signup address with 500 unread messages

> "It's Better To Be In The Spam Box of A Primary Email Address Than To Be In The Primary Box of A Spam Email Address!"

## Decision Rule

Design every communication to land in the A-pile. If half as many people open your message, half as many have a chance to buy.

## Key Quote

> "Everybody always opens all of their 'A' pile mail."
