# Student of Markets

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapters 5-8
Author: Gary Halbert

## Definition

The discipline of continuously studying what people actually buy (not what they say they want), tracking market demand through observable behavior, and identifying hungry audiences before developing products.

## Practice

1. Read the SRDS Direct Mail List Book (or modern equivalents: Amazon bestseller lists, Clickbank, Facebook Ad Library)
2. Subscribe to "hot" mail order publications and study repeating ads
3. Get on every mailing list possible -- watch what offers you receive
4. Pay attention to list sizes, average unit of sale, and buyer recency
5. Track ads that run repeatedly (repetition = profitability)
6. Be skeptical of surveys and stated preferences -- trust purchase data

## Key Insight

People give the "right" answer in surveys but buy what they actually want. 80% said they preferred premium beer; sales data showed most bought regular beer. The National Enquirer is the world's largest newspaper, but nobody admits to reading it.

## Key Quote

> "The very first thing you must come to realize is that you must become a 'student of markets.' Not products. Not techniques. Not copywriting."
> "Sell People What They Want To Buy!"
