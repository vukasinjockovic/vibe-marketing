## Definition

Every special deal, discount, or unusual offer must include a believable explanation for WHY it exists. Without a reason-why, the deal is not believable and the sale is lost.

## Common Reason-Why Structures

- "I'm going out of business"
- "I just had a fire"
- "I owe taxes and must raise money fast"
- "I've lost my lease and must sell before eviction"
- "I've got to make space for new merchandise"

## The Most Powerful Reason-Why

"I am offering you this deal because YOU (by virtue of some unique circumstance) are so special."

Examples:
- "We used your family name for our publicity photos, so we have this product in stock with YOUR crest"
- "Since your name is [X], we have a very limited market"
- "Since you are one of the world's leading [profession]..."
- "A mutual friend, [Name], said I should write to you because..."

## Key Insight

This approach generated $40 million in sales for the coat-of-arms business. The customer feels uniquely positioned, not generically targeted.

## Key Quote

> "When you say, in effect, 'Have I got a deal for you!' you need an explanation as to why you are offering this good deal."
