# Picture With Pleasure

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapters 14, 16-17
Author: Gary Halbert

## Definition

The copywriting technique of using sensory, concrete "word pictures" that help the reader vicariously experience the benefits of owning the product. The reader should be able to feel, smell, see, hear, and taste the outcome.

## Examples

> "Just wait until you step into that warm, inviting Jacuzzi that comes with every apartment. Man oh man! The feel of that soothing bubbling water against your bare skin is just plain heaven."

> "The delightful aroma of these charcoal broiled steaks will remind you how good it feels to be genuinely hungry."

For the Hawaiian beach real estate letter:
- Feel the sand in your toes
- Smell the fresh tang of the salt air
- Drink in the stars with your eyes
- Feel the warm friendly sun on your back

## Concrete vs. Abstract

- BAD: "dramatically increase your sales volume" (abstract, corporate)
- GOOD: "make yourself a bushel of money" (concrete, visual, visceral)

## Application Rule

Replace every abstract benefit claim with a sensory word picture. If the reader cannot see, feel, smell, hear, or taste it, rewrite it.

## Key Quote

> "Bring your story down to earth and hit 'em where they live. In their hearts and their pocketbooks!"
