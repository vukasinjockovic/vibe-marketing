# Nugget Notes

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapter 15
Author: Gary Halbert

## Definition

Halbert's method for pre-writing research. Short, fragmented observations captured while reading source materials. Not full sentences. Not organized. Not censored. Just captured.

## Process

1. Assemble all source materials (lists, competing ads, books in the domain, product info)
2. Read everything and write short nuggets as you go
3. Nuggets can be single words, meaningless phrases, or full thoughts
4. Never worry about whether they make sense
5. Include: product specs, author facts, benefits, word pictures, emotional reactions
6. After reading everything, rate each nugget: * (good), ** (better), *** (red hot)
7. STOP. Put it away for 1-2 days.
8. The "aha experience" -- a breakthrough idea -- will emerge during the rest period
9. Only then begin writing according to AIDA formula

## Key Insight

The subconscious mind processes the assembled material during the rest period. The central selling idea emerges without forcing it. Writing from nugget notes prevents blank-page paralysis.

## Key Quote

> "Sometimes, my nugget notes consist of just one word. Sometimes they consist of meaningless phrases. Many times my notes make sense but many times they don't. No matter. I never worry about it. I just keep writing."
