# Winning Formula

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapter 9
Author: Gary Halbert

## Definition

A proven promotion structure that can be replicated across multiple market segments by customizing the specific details while keeping the core structure and content intact.

## How It Works

1. Test a promotion on one specific audience segment
2. If it works, you have a "winning formula"
3. Keep the first section the same (universal content)
4. Customize the last third for each new audience (profession-specific, location-specific)
5. Customize the headline and opening for each segment
6. Roll out across all viable segments

## Example

"How Chiropractors Can Make Extra Money" works. Keep the universal money-making tips. Swap the customized section for plumbers, architects, dentists, preachers. Swap the headline: "How Plumbers Can Make Extra Money."

## Double Customization

Combine profession + location for maximum relevance:
"How Cardiologists Can Buy L.A. Real Estate With No Money Down"

## Key Quote

> "If this idea actually works, we have something much more valuable than our $9,920.00 profit... what we have is a 'winning formula'!"
> "Ideas breed other ideas."
