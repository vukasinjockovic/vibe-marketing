# The Coat-of-Arms Letter

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapter 18
Author: Gary Halbert

## The Story

Halbert created a family name research report containing a short history of the recipient's surname and a black-and-white drawing of the earliest known coat-of-arms associated with that name. He wrote a one-page, 361-word sales letter to sell it.

The letter was mailed to names from white pages of the telephone book -- by Halbert's own criteria, the worst possible list. Yet it generated 7,156,000 cash-with-order customers, becoming one of the most widely mailed sales letters in history.

## The Follow-Up Failure and Recovery

1. **Catalog attempt:** A 5.5x8.5 four-color catalog with 70 personalized crest items. BOMBED -- didn't even return mailing costs.
2. **Brochure attempt:** An 8.5x11 brochure with the 3 best-selling items. Slightly better than break-even.
3. **Personal letter + photo:** A personal letter with a snapshot of the single best-selling item. Opening: "Dear Mr. Noble, I thought you might like to see what the Noble coat-of-arms looks like in full color so I am sending you the enclosed snapshot." Result: $40 MILLION in sales.

## Lessons

1. A personal letter beats a professional catalog
2. One product beats 70 products
3. "YOU CAN DO A BETTER SELLING JOB WHEN AT FIRST IT DOES NOT APPEAR YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO A SALES JOB"
4. The "you are special" reason-why: "Since we used the [Name] crest for our publicity photos, we have this in stock... and since we can't sell it to anyone unless they are named [Name], we'd like to offer it to you at a true discount."
5. Bond Halbert notes his father spent 18 months revising the original 361-word letter until it achieved "what seemed like perfection."
