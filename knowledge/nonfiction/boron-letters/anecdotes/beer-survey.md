# The Beer Survey

## The Story

A beer company surveyed customers to find out which product they preferred. To their astonishment, 80% said they preferred the premium beer.

But their sales figures showed most people actually bought the regular beer, not the premium.

The surveyed people were trying to give the "right" answer -- the beer they felt they SHOULD drink, not the one they actually purchased.

## Lesson

People's stated preferences diverge wildly from their actual purchasing behavior. Never trust surveys, questionnaires, or what people tell you. Trust the numbers -- what they buy, how often, and how recently.
