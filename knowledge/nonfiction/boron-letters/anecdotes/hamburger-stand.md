# The Hamburger Stand Question

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapter 6
Author: Gary Halbert

## The Story

Halbert asks his copywriting class: "If you and I both owned a hamburger stand and we were in a contest to see who would sell the most hamburgers, what advantages would you most like to have on your side?"

Students answer: superior meat, sesame seed buns, best location, lowest prices.

Halbert responds: "I'll give you every single advantage you asked for. I, myself, only want one advantage and, if you will give it to me, I will whip the pants off of all of you when it comes to selling burgers!"

"What advantage do you want?" they ask.

"The only advantage I want is A STARVING CROWD!"

## Lesson

Market demand trumps everything: product quality, price, location, copy skill. Find the hunger first, then serve the meal.
