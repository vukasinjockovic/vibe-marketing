# The Robert Collier Dollar Bill Letter

Source: The Boron Letters, Chapter 24
Author: Gary Halbert (referencing Robert Collier)

## The Story

A first-class letter designed to raise funds for a children's hospital. When the recipient opened the envelope, they found a personal, typed letter with a real dollar bill attached.

The copy explained: the writer wanted to donate $1,000 to the hospital but realized that wasn't enough. So he divided his contribution into 1,000 one-dollar bills and mailed each one to a different person, hoping each recipient would forward the dollar to the hospital along with one or more dollars of their own.

## Result

Better than 90% response rate. The people who received it eventually contributed tens of millions of dollars.

"Probably the most effective direct mail promotion ever mailed."

## Lesson

1. A physical grabber (the dollar bill) gets instant, focused attention
2. The grabber ties in naturally with the message (fundraising)
3. The reason-why is believable and emotionally compelling
4. The ask is small (forward this dollar) but triggers reciprocity and guilt
5. Making it easy to act (pre-addressed envelope, stamp) removes friction
