## The Study

Stanley Milgram's landmark Yale experiment: subjects were instructed by a lab-coated experimenter to deliver increasingly powerful electric shocks to a "learner" (actually a confederate) who screamed in pain.

## Key Findings

- **65% of subjects** delivered the maximum 450-volt shock despite the learner's screams, pleas, and eventual silence
- Subjects were visibly distressed but continued because the authority figure said to
- The experiment has been replicated across cultures and decades with similar results

> "It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that constitutes the chief finding of the study." -- Milgram (Ch. 5)

## The Nurse Study

95% of nurses obeyed a fake phone order from an unknown "doctor" to administer double the maximum dose of an unauthorized drug to a patient -- violating multiple hospital rules simultaneously.

## What It Illustrates

Authority is one of the most powerful compliance triggers. The mechanism: deep-seated socialization from birth that "obedience to proper authority is right and disobedience is wrong." Symbols of authority (lab coat, title) were sufficient -- no actual authority was needed.

## Agent Application

Demonstrates why authority signals (credentials, professional presentation, expert language) are so effective in marketing. Also a warning: authority can be faked with mere symbols. Ethical copy uses GENUINE authority backed by real expertise and trustworthiness.
