## The Story

G. Gordon Liddy presented Attorney General John Mitchell with three increasingly expensive plans for illegal intelligence operations:

1. **Plan 1**: $1 million -- kidnapping, mugging squads, sabotage, prostitutes for blackmail (REJECTED)
2. **Plan 2**: $500,000 -- scaled back version (REJECTED)
3. **Plan 3**: $250,000 -- "bare-bones" wiretapping and burglary of DNC headquarters (APPROVED)

Mitchell approved the third plan -- which was still patently absurd and illegal -- because relative to the first two proposals, it seemed like a reasonable concession.

## What It Illustrates

Rejection-then-retreat at the highest level of government. The contrast between $1 million in kidnapping/prostitution schemes and $250,000 in burglary made the latter seem "modest." Two mechanisms at work: reciprocal concession (Liddy appeared to be making sacrifices) and contrast principle (Plan 3 looked small next to Plans 1 and 2).

## Agent Application

Demonstrates both the power and the danger of the technique. The first request must be large enough to make the retreat meaningful but not so extreme as to appear unreasonable. Cialdini notes that the "truly gifted negotiator is one whose initial position is exaggerated just enough to allow for a series of small reciprocal concessions."
