## The Study

Dennis Regan's experiment: a confederate named "Joe" worked alongside subjects on an art-rating task. During a break, Joe left and returned with two Cokes, giving one to the subject unsolicited ("I asked him if he wanted one and he said yes, so I bought you one too").

Later, Joe asked subjects to buy raffle tickets. Those who received the free Coke bought twice as many tickets -- a 500% ROI on a 10-cent Coke.

## Key Finding

Liking for Joe was irrelevant. Whether subjects rated Joe as likable or unlikable, if they'd received the Coke, they bought more tickets. The reciprocity rule overwhelmed personal preference.

> "The rule says that we should try to repay what another person has provided us." (Ch. 2)

## What It Illustrates

1. Reciprocity overrides liking -- you don't have to be liked to benefit from giving
2. Small, unsolicited gifts create disproportionate obligation
3. The gift need not be requested to trigger obligation

## Agent Application

Lead with genuine value (free content, tools, samples) before making any ask. The reciprocity effect operates even when the prospect didn't request the value. Small gifts create disproportionately large return compliance.
