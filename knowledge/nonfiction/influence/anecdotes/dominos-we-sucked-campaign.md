## The Story

Domino's Pizza launched the "NEW DOMINO'S" campaign, publicly admitting that their pizza had been terrible. They showed real customer complaints, acknowledged the criticism, and promised they had rebuilt their recipes from scratch.

Result: sales and stock price soared.

## What It Illustrates

The weakness-first trustworthiness tactic at corporate scale. By admitting a genuine weakness (bad pizza), Domino's:
1. Built instant trustworthiness -- a company that admits failure is believable when it claims improvement
2. Created a narrative of transformation that engaged customers emotionally
3. Made subsequent quality claims far more credible

## Related Examples

- Warren Buffett opens annual reports with his mistakes to build trust for subsequent claims
- L'Oreal: "We're not the cheapest, but you're worth it"
- Trial attorneys who admit a weakness before opposing counsel points it out win more often

## Agent Application

When rebranding, relaunching, or addressing known weaknesses: own the flaw publicly and immediately pivot to the improvement. The admission of weakness is not a cost -- it is an investment in credibility that pays compound interest on every subsequent claim.
