## The Story

A friend of Cialdini's ran a Native Indian jewelry store in Arizona. A batch of turquoise jewelry wouldn't sell despite being good quality at fair prices during peak tourist season. She tried repositioning and pushing through sales staff -- nothing worked.

Before leaving town, she scrawled a note: "Everything in this display case, price x 1/2." The employee misread the "1/2" as "2" and doubled the price. Everything sold immediately.

## What It Illustrates

The "expensive = good" shortcut (click-run automaticity). Well-to-do vacationers with little knowledge of turquoise used price as a trigger feature for quality. When the price doubled, the automatic "expensive = good" program activated and they bought eagerly.

> "Price alone had become a trigger feature for quality, and a dramatic increase in price alone had led to a dramatic increase in sales among the quality-hungry buyers." (Ch. 1)

## Agent Application

Demonstrates that price is not just a cost signal but a quality signal. For premium audiences with limited domain expertise, higher prices can INCREASE perceived value and conversion. Underpricing can signal low quality.
