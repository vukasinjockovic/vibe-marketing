## The Story

The Tupperware home-demonstration party is Cialdini's premier example of principle stacking. A friend (the hostess) invites guests to her home to see Tupperware demonstrated. The hostess, not a professional salesperson, is the real selling agent.

## All Seven Principles at Work

1. **Reciprocity**: Guests receive gifts and refreshments before any selling begins
2. **Liking**: The hostess is a friend; guests are buying from someone they like
3. **Social Proof**: Each purchase by a guest validates the product for others; the demonstrated popularity builds
4. **Authority**: Tupperware's brand quality and the demonstrator's product knowledge
5. **Scarcity**: Special party-only offers and limited quantities
6. **Commitment/Consistency**: Public testimonials from guests about past Tupperware satisfaction
7. **Unity**: "Welcome to the Tupperware family" language; shared experience of the party

## Key Finding

"The social bond between the hostess and the guest is twice as likely to determine a purchase as product preference." (Ch. 3)

## Agent Application

The ultimate demonstration that principle stacking is multiplicative. When designing campaigns, look for opportunities to layer multiple principles. A single touchpoint (email, landing page, event) should deploy at least 2-3 principles simultaneously.
