## The Study

Cialdini's own research at Arizona's Petrified Forest, where theft of petrified wood was a major problem. Two different signs were tested:

1. **Sign depicting multiple thieves** (showing widespread theft): Theft TRIPLED to 7.92%
2. **Sign depicting a lone thief** (showing individual deviance): Theft dropped to 1.67%

## What It Illustrates

"The Big Mistake" -- Cialdini's most important anti-pattern. Communicating the prevalence of an undesirable behavior normalizes it through social proof, making it WORSE.

> "Within the lament 'Look at all the people doing this bad thing' lurks the message 'Look at all the people doing it.'" (Ch. 4)

## Related Findings

- Suicide-prevention programs that emphasized alarming rates actually INCREASED teen consideration of suicide
- Anti-alcohol programs that communicated how many teens drank INCREASED perceived drinking norms
- Anti-piracy campaigns that cite billions in losses implicitly communicate that piracy is ubiquitous

## Agent Application

This is the single most important anti-pattern in persuasion copy. NEVER frame the problem you solve as common or widespread. Don't say "millions of people suffer from X" -- you normalize X. Instead, frame the SOLUTION as the popular behavior: "Join the thousands who have already solved X."
