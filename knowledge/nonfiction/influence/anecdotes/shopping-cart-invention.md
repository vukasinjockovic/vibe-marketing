## The Story

Sylvan Goldman invented the shopping cart for his Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain. Nobody used it. He put up signs explaining the benefits. Nobody used it. He had employees try to convince customers. Nobody used it.

Finally, he hired fake shoppers to push carts through the store. Real customers, seeing others using carts, followed suit. Goldman died with a $400 million estate.

## What It Illustrates

Social proof as the ultimate adoption trigger. Information (signs), persuasion (employees), and rational argument all failed. Only seeing similar others use the product worked.

## Agent Application

When launching a new product or behavior, showing others already using it is more effective than explaining why they should. User photos, video testimonials, visible customer counts, and "most popular" labels all serve as Goldman's fake shoppers -- seeding the social proof that triggers adoption.
