## The Story

Joe Girard, listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's greatest car salesman, sent over 13,000 customers greeting cards every single month -- more than 150,000 cards per year. Every card contained the same message: "I like you."

The message wasn't personalized. Everyone knew it was mass-produced. It still worked. Girard sold an average of five cars and trucks per day.

> "There is nothing more effective in selling anything than getting customers to believe, really believe, you like them." -- Joe Girard (Ch. 3)

## What It Illustrates

The liking principle and the power of familiarity through repeated positive contact. Even formulaic expressions of liking create obligation and warmth. Girard's system combined:
- **Liking** (expressed affection)
- **Familiarity** (monthly contact)
- **Reciprocity** (the cards were gifts of attention)

## Agent Application

Regular, positive touchpoints build liking even when obviously automated. Email sequences, newsletters, and social media posts that express genuine appreciation for the audience leverage this. The key: sincerity of the sentiment matters more than personalization of the delivery.
