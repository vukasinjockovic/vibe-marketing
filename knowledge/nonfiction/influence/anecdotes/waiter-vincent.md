## The Story

Vincent was a waiter who consistently earned the highest tips at his restaurant. His technique: when a guest ordered, he would lean in conspiratorially and say something like "I'm afraid that is not as good tonight as it normally is. Might I recommend instead the [cheaper dish] or the [cheaper dish]?" -- arguing AGAINST his own financial interest.

Having established himself as a trusted advisor by recommending cheaper items, he then steered the table's wine and dessert choices toward expensive options. His recommendations were accepted without question.

## What It Illustrates

The weakness-first trustworthiness tactic combined with principle stacking:
1. **Authority** (expertise about food quality)
2. **Trustworthiness** (recommending against his own interest proves he's honest)
3. **Reciprocity** (he "saved" them money, so they feel obligated)
4. **Liking** (the conspiratorial lean-in creates intimacy)

The minor loss on the entree was more than recovered by unchallenged premium wine and dessert sales.

## Agent Application

Demonstrate trustworthiness by recommending against your own interest on a minor point. This builds credibility for the major recommendation that follows. "Product X isn't right for everyone -- if you need Y, look elsewhere. But if you need Z, nothing beats it."
