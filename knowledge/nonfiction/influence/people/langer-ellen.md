## Who

Ellen Langer is a social psychologist at Harvard University. Cialdini cites her copy machine experiment as the definitive demonstration of "click, run" automaticity in humans.

## Key Contributions Referenced

### The Copy Machine Experiment (Chapter 1)
Langer tested three versions of a request to cut in line at a library copier:

1. **Request only**: "May I use the Xerox machine?" -- 60% compliance
2. **Request + real reason**: "...because I'm in a rush" -- 94% compliance
3. **Request + meaningless reason**: "...because I have to make some copies" -- 93% compliance

The word "because" alone -- without any new information -- triggered near-total compliance. This demonstrated that humans respond to trigger features (the word "because") rather than the actual content of the reason.

## Relevance to Agent

Langer's experiment is the bridge between animal fixed-action patterns and human click-run behavior. It proves that providing a reason (even a hollow one) dramatically increases compliance. In copy: always provide a "because" -- a reason-why behind every claim and every ask.
