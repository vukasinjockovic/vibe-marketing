## Who

Stanley Milgram (1933-1984) was a social psychologist at Yale University, best known for his obedience experiments demonstrating that ordinary people would administer apparently lethal electric shocks when instructed by an authority figure.

## Key Contributions Referenced

### The Obedience Experiment (Chapter 5)
- 65% of subjects delivered maximum 450-volt shock to a screaming, pleading person
- Subjects were visibly distressed but continued on authority's command
- Replicated across cultures and decades with similar results

> "It is the extreme willingness of adults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that constitutes the chief finding of the study." -- Milgram (Ch. 5)

### What Cialdini Draws from Milgram
The authority principle: humans have deep-seated socialization from birth that "obedience to proper authority is right and disobedience is wrong." This tendency usually serves us well (authorities typically have superior information) but can be exploited.

## Relevance to Agent

Milgram's research is the empirical foundation for the authority principle. It demonstrates why authority signals (titles, credentials, uniforms) are so powerful in compliance -- and why ethical restraint is necessary when wielding them.
