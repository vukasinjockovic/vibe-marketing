## Who

David Phillips is a sociologist at the University of California, San Diego. Cialdini extensively cites his research on the "Werther Effect" -- how publicized suicides produce copycat suicides.

## Key Contributions Referenced

### The Werther Effect Research (Chapter 4)
- Front-page suicide stories produce an average of 58 additional suicides
- Copycat demographics precisely match the original: young victim triggers young imitators, old victim triggers old imitators
- Even "disguised" suicides appear as single-car crashes and small private plane accidents, with driver/pilot demographics matching the original victim
- More publicity = larger subsequent increase

### Extension to Homicides
Phillips also found that publicized murder-suicides produce copycat effects: after a publicized murder-suicide, airline crashes and multi-fatality car accidents increase.

## Relevance to Agent

Phillips' research provides the empirical foundation for Cialdini's "Big Mistake" anti-pattern. It is the most dramatic evidence that publicizing the frequency of undesirable behavior normalizes it through social proof -- even to the point of triggering death.
