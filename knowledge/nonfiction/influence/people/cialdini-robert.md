## Who

Robert B. Cialdini is Regents' Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Marketing at Arizona State University. He is the world's foremost expert on the science of influence and persuasion. His book "Influence" (originally 1984, expanded 2021) has sold over 5 million copies and is considered the foundational text on ethical persuasion.

## Note

This researcher is the author of "Influence, New and Expanded" in our collection. His frameworks and concepts are documented separately.

## Key Contributions

### The Seven Principles of Influence
Cialdini identified six original principles (Reciprocity, Liking, Social Proof, Authority, Scarcity, Commitment/Consistency) and added Unity as the seventh in the 2021 expanded edition.

### Research Method
Cialdini spent three years undercover in sales training programs, fundraising organizations, and other "compliance professions" to observe persuasion techniques in the wild, then validated observations with controlled experiments.

### The Big Mistake (Original Research)
Cialdini's own Petrified Forest experiment demonstrated that signs showing widespread theft tripled theft rates -- his signature finding about the misuse of social proof.

### Ethical Persuasion Framework
Cialdini consistently advocates for ethical application: "Favors are to be met with favors; it does not require that tricks be met with favors." His defense chapters teach people to recognize and resist unethical influence.

## Relevance to Agent

Cialdini is the primary authority behind the persuasion psychology skill. All seven principles, their mechanisms, sub-techniques, and anti-patterns derive from his work.
