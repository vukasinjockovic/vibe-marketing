## Summary

Named after Goethe's novel "The Sorrows of Young Werther" (1774), which triggered a wave of copycat suicides across Europe. The Werther Effect describes how publicized suicides produce additional suicides that mirror the original.

## Key Findings (David Phillips' Research)

- Front-page suicide stories produce an average of 58 additional suicides in the following period
- Copycat suicides precisely match victim demographics: young victim triggers young imitators; older victim triggers older imitators
- Even "disguised" suicides appear: single-car crashes and small private plane crashes increase after publicized suicides, with driver/pilot demographics matching the original victim
- The more publicity the original suicide receives, the larger the increase in subsequent deaths

## The Mechanism

Social proof operating at its most destructive: uncertain, distressed people look to the actions of similar others to determine what behavior is "appropriate" for someone in their situation.

## Connection to "The Big Mistake"

This is the most dramatic example of Cialdini's anti-pattern: publicizing the frequency of undesirable behavior normalizes it via social proof. Media coverage that emphasizes "epidemic" rates of suicide inadvertently provides social proof that suicide is a common response to despair.

## Agent Application

The Werther Effect is a cautionary tale for the "Big Mistake" anti-pattern. Never frame the problem you're solving as widespread or common -- you normalize it. Instead, frame the SOLUTION as the common behavior: "Most people who face X choose to Y."
