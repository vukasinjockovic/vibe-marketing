## Summary

Humans, like animals, have "fixed-action patterns" -- automatic behavioral programs triggered by specific features in the environment. Cialdini calls this "click, run": click (trigger feature detected), run (automatic behavior program executes).

> "Click, and the appropriate program is activated; run, and out rolls the standard sequence of behaviors." (Ch. 1)

## Key Examples

- Mother turkey attacks polecat -- but embraces it when it plays "cheep-cheep" sound
- Ellen Langer's copy machine experiment: the word "because" triggered compliance even without a real reason (93% vs 60%)
- Turquoise jewelry sold at double price because "expensive = good" shortcut activated

## Why It Exists

Modern life is too complex for full analysis of every decision. Shortcuts are efficient and usually correct. But they can be exploited by those who know the trigger features.

> "You and I exist in an extraordinarily complicated environment, easily the most rapidly moving and complex ever on this planet." (Ch. 1)

## Agent Application

All seven principles of influence work because they exploit click-run patterns. Understanding that compliance is often automatic (not deliberate) is foundational to all persuasion copy. The goal is to present the right trigger features honestly.
