## Summary

When two items are presented sequentially, the second item is perceived as more different from the first than it actually is. This perceptual principle operates across all senses and all domains of judgment.

> "Sell the suit first, because when it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices will not seem as high in comparison." (Ch. 1)

## How It Works

- Hand in cold water, then lukewarm water = lukewarm feels hot
- See expensive item first, then moderate item = moderate seems cheap
- Hear bad news first, then neutral news = neutral seems good

## Commercial Applications

- Real estate agents show "setup" properties (overpriced, run-down) first, then the real target property
- Auto dealers negotiate car price before suggesting options -- $200 accessories seem trivial after a $35,000 commitment
- Rejection-then-retreat uses contrast: the real request seems small after the inflated first request

## Agent Application

Always present the higher-priced or worse option FIRST. Anchor high, then reveal the actual offer. In tiered pricing, display premium tier first. In problem-solution copy, dramatize the problem's full cost before revealing your solution's price.
