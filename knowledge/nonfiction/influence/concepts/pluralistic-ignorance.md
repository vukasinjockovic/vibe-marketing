## Summary

In ambiguous situations, each person looks to others for guidance on how to act. If everyone is looking and no one is acting, each person concludes that action is not needed -- even when it clearly is. This is "pluralistic ignorance."

## The Bystander Effect

Cialdini connects pluralistic ignorance to the failure to help in emergencies:
- The more witnesses present, the LESS likely any individual is to help
- Each bystander sees other bystanders not acting and concludes the situation is not an emergency
- Kitty Genovese case (though Cialdini notes the original reporting was exaggerated)

## How Social Proof Cascades Go Wrong

The Singapore bank run: a bus strike created a crowd at the bus stop near the bank. Passersby assumed the crowd was withdrawing funds. The bank was forced to close.

> "We seem to assume that if a lot of people are doing the same thing, they must know something we don't." (Ch. 4)

## Agent Application

When writing copy for inaction problems (health screening, insurance, financial planning), explicitly break the pluralistic ignorance cycle: "Most people assume everyone else has this handled. They don't." Naming the inaction pattern gives the reader permission to act.
