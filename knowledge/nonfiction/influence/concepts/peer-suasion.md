## Summary

Social proof is most powerful when it comes from SIMILAR others. Cialdini uses the term "peer-suasion" -- persuasion through peers who match the target's demographics, situation, or identity.

## Evidence

- Hotel towel reuse signs: "75% of guests IN THIS ROOM reused towels" outperformed "75% of guests at this hotel" and generic environmental appeals
- Suicide copycats (Werther Effect) match victim demographics precisely: young victim triggers young imitators, old victim triggers old imitators
- Anti-smoking campaigns featuring teen peers outperform those featuring authority figures

## The Mechanism

People look to similar others because:
1. Similar others face similar constraints (feasibility signal)
2. Similar others have similar values (validity signal)
3. Similar others define the in-group norm (social acceptance signal)

## Agent Application

Always match testimonial demographics to target audience. "People like you" is more persuasive than "experts say" for most consumer decisions. When selecting case studies, prioritize similarity to the prospect over impressiveness of the result.
