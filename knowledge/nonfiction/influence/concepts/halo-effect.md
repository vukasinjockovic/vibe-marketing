## Summary

One positive trait (especially physical attractiveness) colors judgment of all other traits. People automatically assign good-looking people "talent, kindness, honesty, agreeableness, trustworthiness, and intelligence."

## Evidence from Cialdini

- Attractive defendants receive lighter sentences in court
- Attractive candidates get more votes (but voters deny appearance influenced them)
- Good-looking people are hired more often and at higher salaries
- Attractive children who misbehave are judged less harshly

## How Liking Leverages the Halo Effect

The halo effect is the MECHANISM behind the liking principle. When any positive quality is established (similarity, compliments, familiarity, association), it radiates outward to color perception of the entire offer.

## Agent Application

Professional presentation, clean design, and quality visuals trigger the halo effect for brands. First impressions in copy (strong opening, polished tone) color how the entire piece is received. Testimonials from attractive, relatable people benefit from the halo effect extending to the product.
