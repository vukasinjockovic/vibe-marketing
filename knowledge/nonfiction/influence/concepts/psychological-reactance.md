## Summary

When freedoms are restricted or threatened, people experience a motivational state (reactance) that drives them to restore the threatened freedom. They want the restricted item MORE, not less.

## Key Findings

- Strongest during developmental periods: "terrible twos" and teenage years, when autonomy is being established
- Censored information is perceived as more valuable and more believable
- The "Romeo and Juliet effect": parental interference intensifies romantic attraction
- Banned books become bestsellers; censored messages become more persuasive

## Newly Scarce vs. Always Scarce

Items that were previously available but are now restricted are valued MORE than items that were always scarce. The loss of a freedom is more motivating than never having had it.

> "People assign more value to opportunities that are less available." (Ch. 6)

## Competition Amplifies Reactance

When others compete for the same scarce resource, reactance intensifies further. Auctions, bidding wars, and "only 2 left" messaging exploit this.

## Agent Application

Scarcity messaging works because it triggers reactance. But the scarcity must be REAL -- artificial restriction detected later causes severe backlash. Emphasize what the prospect will LOSE by not acting, not just what they will gain. Frame deadlines as freedom-preserving: "Act now while you still have the choice."
