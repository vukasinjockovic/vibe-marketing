## Core Principle

Make a large request first (expected to be refused), then "retreat" to the real, smaller request. The smaller request appears as a concession, triggering reciprocal concession from the target.

> "Three times as many of the students approached in this manner volunteered to serve as zoo chaperons." (Ch. 2)

## How It Works

Two mechanisms operate simultaneously:
1. **Reciprocal concession**: The retreat looks like a concession, triggering the reciprocity rule
2. **Contrast principle**: The smaller request seems even smaller compared to the large one

## Critical Rules

- The first request must NOT be so extreme as to appear unreasonable or the tactic backfires
- The retreater appears to be the one making a sacrifice
- Produces greater follow-through AND willingness to agree to future requests (unlike other compliance techniques)

## Famous Example: Watergate

Liddy presented three plans to AG Mitchell:
1. $1 million plan (rejected)
2. $500,000 plan (rejected)
3. $250,000 plan (approved)

The "bare-bones" plan was still absurd -- but relative to the first proposals, it seemed reasonable.

## Agent Application

Use when structuring offers with multiple tiers. Present premium/enterprise tier first, then standard tier. The standard tier benefits from both the reciprocal concession and the contrast effect.
