## Core Principle

Cialdini identifies seven universal principles of persuasion that function as mental shortcuts ("click, run" responses) exploited by compliance professionals. Each principle triggers automatic behavior programs that evolved to handle the complexity of modern life efficiently.

> "Click, and the appropriate program is activated; run, and out rolls the standard sequence of behaviors." (Ch. 1)

## The Seven Principles

| # | Principle | Core Mechanism | Trigger |
|---|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | **Reciprocity** | Obligation to repay what others give us | Gift, favor, concession |
| 2 | **Liking** | We comply with those we like | Similarity, compliments, familiarity, attractiveness, association |
| 3 | **Social Proof** | We determine correct behavior by observing what others do | Popularity, testimonials, peer behavior |
| 4 | **Authority** | We defer to those with expertise and legitimate power | Titles, credentials, clothing, trustworthiness |
| 5 | **Scarcity** | We value what is rare or diminishing in availability | Limited quantity, deadlines, exclusivity |
| 6 | **Commitment/Consistency** | We strive to be consistent with prior commitments | Small initial agreement, public statement |
| 7 | **Unity** | We say yes to those we consider "one of us" | Shared identity, kinship, co-creation |

## Key Insight: Principle Stacking

Principles are multiplicative, not additive. The Tupperware party deploys all seven simultaneously. Rejection-then-retreat engages both reciprocity AND the contrast principle.

## Defense Against Each

Cialdini provides a defense chapter for each principle. The universal defense: recognize the automatic trigger, then ask whether the compliance is truly in your interest.

## Relevance to Agent

This is the master framework. Every persuasion decision begins by selecting which principle(s) to deploy based on the audience's primary barrier to conversion.
