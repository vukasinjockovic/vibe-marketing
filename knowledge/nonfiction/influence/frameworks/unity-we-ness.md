# Unity: The "We"-ness Principle
Source: Robert Cialdini, "Influence, New and Expanded" (2021), Chapter 8
Type: Framework

## Core Principle

Unity is distinct from liking. Liking operates on similarity and association. Unity operates on shared IDENTITY -- the feeling that "this person is one of us." It is Cialdini's seventh principle, added in the expanded edition.

> "People say yes to someone they consider one of them." (Ch. 8)
> "The experience of 'we'-ness (unity) with others is about shared identities -- tribe-like categories that individuals use to define themselves and their groups." (Ch. 8)

## How Unity Is Created

### Being Together (Shared Categories)
1. **Kinship** -- Family, genetic overlap, genealogy. Even imagined genetic overlap (overlapping fingerprints) increases helping behavior.
2. **Place** -- Shared locality, home, region, nationality. "Where are you from?" creates instant connection.

### Acting Together (Shared Experience)
1. **Synchronous activity** -- Shared musical experience, coordinated movement, marching together. Creates perceived kinship.
2. **Co-creation** -- Involving others in building something creates ownership and loyalty. IKEA effect applied to relationships.
3. **Shared suffering** -- Joint adversity bonds people deeply. Common enemy creates unity.
4. **Reciprocal self-disclosure** -- Sharing personal information builds "we"-ness.

## Distinction from Liking

| Liking | Unity |
|--------|-------|
| "I like this person" | "This person is one of US" |
| Based on similarity, compliments | Based on shared identity, belonging |
| Creates preference | Creates loyalty |
| Can be manufactured easily | Requires genuine shared experience or identity |

## Warning

Corporate "we" language in ethics codes actually increased lying and cheating. Unity can be weaponized by bad actors within the group.

## Agent Application

Use "we" language that invokes genuine shared identity, not hollow corporate "we." Create co-creation opportunities (user-generated content, community input). Frame the brand community as a tribe with shared values. Use place-based identity where relevant ("Made by [locals] for [locals]").
