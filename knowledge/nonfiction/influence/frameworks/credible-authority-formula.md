## Core Principle

Credible authority = Expertise + Trustworthiness. Both components are necessary. Expertise alone without trust produces skepticism. Trust alone without expertise produces empathy but not compliance.

> "Follow an expert." -- Virgil (Ch. 5)

## The Weakness-First Tactic

The most powerful way to establish trustworthiness: acknowledge a (usually minor) shortcoming EARLY in the message, then follow immediately with your strongest point. The admission builds credibility that amplifies all subsequent claims.

Evidence:
- Trial attorneys who admit a weakness before the rival points it out are viewed as more credible and win more often
- Domino's "NEW DOMINO'S" campaign admitted past poor pizza quality -- sales and stock price soared
- Warren Buffett opens annual reports with mistakes to build trust for subsequent claims
- L'Oreal's "We're not the cheapest, but you're worth it" = weakness-first positioning

## Multiple Authorities

> "Audiences trust and follow the advice of a set of experts more than that of any one of them." (Ch. 5)

Citing multiple experts beats citing one.

## Three Authority Signals

1. **Titles** -- Doctor, Professor, CEO (even when hollow, titles influence)
2. **Clothing** -- Professional attire, uniforms, lab coats
3. **Trappings** -- Luxury items, prestigious office, quality materials

## Agent Application

When writing copy that needs to establish authority: lead with a genuine minor weakness, pivot to the strongest claim. Use multiple expert citations rather than relying on a single source. Display credentials visually (logos, certifications) alongside written claims.
