## Core Principle

Once a person makes a commitment (action, stand, or position), they experience internal and external pressure to behave consistently with that commitment. Commitments are most powerful when they satisfy five criteria.

> "After making a commitment (that is, taking an action, stand, or position), people are more willing to agree to requests in keeping with the prior commitment." (Ch. 7)

## The Five Power Factors

### 1. Active (Not Passive)
Written or spoken commitments bind more strongly than passive agreement. Getting someone to write down their goal is dramatically more effective than having them think about it.

### 2. Public (Visible to Others)
Public commitments create social pressure to follow through. Private commitments can be revised quietly; public ones cannot.

### 3. Effortful (Required Work)
The more effort required to make the commitment, the stronger the bond. Hazing rituals, difficult application processes, and challenging onboarding all increase commitment.

### 4. Voluntary (Not Coerced)
Commitments made freely generate internal motivation. Coerced commitments produce compliance only while the external pressure remains.

### 5. Identity-Changing (Shifts Self-Image)
The most powerful commitments alter how the person sees themselves. "I am the kind of person who..." becomes a self-reinforcing engine.

## Key Techniques

- **Foot-in-the-door**: Small initial request leads to larger compliance
- **Low-ball**: Secure commitment, then reveal additional costs (commitment "grows its own legs")
- **Labeling/Altercasting**: Assign a positive identity trait that the person then acts to confirm
- **Reminder**: Re-invoking a prior commitment regenerates and intensifies its force

## Agent Application

In copy: get micro-commitments early (quiz, self-assessment, free trial sign-up). Make commitments public where possible (share buttons, community membership). Frame product use as identity ("You're the kind of person who..."). Use progressive commitment ladders from small to large asks.
