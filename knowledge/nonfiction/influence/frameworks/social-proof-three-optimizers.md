# Social Proof: Three Optimizers

## Core Principle

Social proof operates through three optimizers that determine its strength. Each amplifies the effect; all three together create maximum influence.

> "Since 95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer." (Ch. 4)

## The Three Optimizers

### 1. Uncertainty
When people don't know what to do, they look to others. The more uncertain the situation, the more powerful social proof becomes.

### 2. The Many
The more people doing something, the stronger the signal. "Popularity precipitates popularity."
- Beijing restaurant: labeling items "most popular" increased sales 13-20%
- Netflix: sharing what was popular made those shows more popular

### 3. Similarity (Peer-Suasion)
People follow those who are LIKE them. Testimonials from similar others are far more persuasive than celebrity endorsements for most audiences.
- Suicide copycats match victim demographics: young victim triggers young imitators
- Hotel towel reuse: "75% of guests IN THIS ROOM" outperformed generic "75% of guests"

## Future Social Proof (Trending)

When current numbers are small, show the TREND. Growing adoption signals future popularity.

> "Even though only a minority of peers conserved, the number who did conserve was increasing. So informed, these subjects used the least water of all." (Ch. 4)

## The Big Mistake (Anti-Pattern)

Never communicate that many people do an undesirable behavior. "Within the lament 'Look at all the people doing this bad thing' lurks the message 'Look at all the people doing it.'"

## Agent Application

When writing social proof: (1) emphasize uncertainty the reader feels, (2) cite large numbers, (3) match testimonial demographics to target audience. When numbers are small, use trending language. NEVER normalize the problem you're solving by emphasizing how common it is.
