# 3Ds Employee Training Model
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Document Demonstrate Duplicate, 3Ds, DDD Training Model

## Summary
A three-step training framework for transferring advertising skills to employees: Document (create a step-by-step checklist), Demonstrate (perform the process in front of the trainee while narrating), Duplicate (have the trainee perform it in front of you while you correct in real time). Skipping any step creates failure modes: without documentation, knowledge stays in one head; without demonstration, checklists get misinterpreted; without duplication, you cannot verify competence.

## Key Findings
1. Documentation must be a checklist, not a narrative. Checklists are actionable; narratives are not.

2. Demonstration includes narration of reasoning, not just physical execution.

3. Duplication must happen with the trainer watching and correcting in real time.
