**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Hook-Retain-Reward, Content Unit Framework, HRR Framework

## Summary
Every piece of content -- regardless of length, format, or platform -- has exactly three elements: Hook (get attention), Retain (keep attention), and Reward (deliver value). The Hook determines whether anyone sees the content at all. Retain keeps them engaged. Reward determines whether they come back for more. This framework applies to a tweet, a blog post, a video, a podcast episode, or any other content format.

## Key Findings
1. Hook uses seven components: Recency, Relevancy, Celebrity, Proximity, Conflict, Unusual, Ongoing.
