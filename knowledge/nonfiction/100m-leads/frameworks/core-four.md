# Core Four Framework
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Core 4, Four Ways to Advertise, Core Four Advertising Methods

## Summary
The Core Four is Hormozi's taxonomy of the only four ways any business can let people know about what it sells. They are organized along two axes: warm vs. cold audience, and one-to-one vs. one-to-many delivery. Every advertising activity in history is a variation of one of these four methods. The framework provides both a diagnostic ("which of the four am I doing?") and a scaling roadmap ("which should I add next?").

## Key Findings
1. The four methods are: Warm Outreach (1-to-1, warm), Post Free Content (1-to-many, warm), Cold Outreach (1-to-1, cold), Run Paid Ads (1-to-many, cold).

2. Every business uses some combination of these four. There are no other methods.

3. Warm methods have higher conversion but limited reach. Cold methods have unlimited reach but lower conversion.
