**Aliases:** What-Who-When, WWW Framework, Ad Angle Generator

## Summary
A combinatorial framework for generating hundreds of unique ad angles from a single offer. It multiplies three dimensions: WHAT (8 value elements from the Value Equation and their opposites), WHO (9 different perspectives through which to present the outcome), and WHEN (3 time horizons: past, present, future). This produces up to 216 unique angles per offer, making it nearly impossible to run out of fresh ad creative.

## Key Findings
1. WHAT includes 8 value elements: Dream Outcome (+), Nightmare Outcome (-), Perceived Likelihood (+), Perceived Impossibility (-), Speed (+), Time Delay (-), Ease (+), Effort & Sacrifice (-).
