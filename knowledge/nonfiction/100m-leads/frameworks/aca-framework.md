# ACA Framework (Acknowledge-Compliment-Ask)
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** ACA, Acknowledge Compliment Ask, Warm Outreach Framework

## Summary
A three-step conversational framework for initiating warm outreach without feeling salesy. Acknowledge (reference their last message, post, or life event), Compliment (genuine specific praise), Ask (the indirect referral question: "Do you know anyone who...?"). The framework prevents the common anti-pattern of jumping straight to a pitch, which burns warm relationships.

## Key Findings
1. The sequence must be in order: Acknowledge first, Compliment second, Ask third. Skipping steps makes the ask feel transactional.

2. The Ask should be indirect: "Do you know anyone who..." rather than "Would you be interested in..."

3. If the contact says "Actually, I might be interested," proceed with the value pitch naturally.
