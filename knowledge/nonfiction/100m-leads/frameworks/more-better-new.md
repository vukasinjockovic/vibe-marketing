# More Better New Framework
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** More-Better-New, MBN Framework, Maximizing Framework

## Summary
A sequencing framework for scaling advertising results. The core insight is that entrepreneurs instinctively jump to "new" (new platforms, new methods) when the biggest gains come from doing "more" of what already works, then making it "better" through systematic testing, and only then trying "new" approaches. The sequence is strict: More first, Better second, New last.

## Key Findings
1. "More" means increasing volume of existing activities. Ask: "What keeps me from doing 10x the volume?"

2. "Better" means finding the constraint (biggest drop-off) and testing one variable per week to improve it.

3. "New" means adding new platforms, methods, or Core Four activities -- only after more and better are maximized.
