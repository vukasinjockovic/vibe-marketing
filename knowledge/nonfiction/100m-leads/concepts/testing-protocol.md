**Aliases:** One Test Per Week, Testing Framework, Advertising Testing

## Summary
A disciplined approach to improving advertising: test one variable per week per platform. Change only one thing at a time so results can be attributed. Winners become the new control. All tests are logged with date, variable, hypothesis, and result. This prevents the common failure of changing multiple variables simultaneously and losing the ability to learn from results.

## Key Findings
1. One test per week, one variable. That's it.
