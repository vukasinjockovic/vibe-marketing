## Summary
A re-engagement email template credited to Dean Jackson. Subject line: "[First name]?" Body: "Are you still looking to [4-word desire]?" The power is in its brevity and personal tone -- it reads like a text from a friend, not a marketing email. Used to reactivate cold or dormant leads.

## Key Findings
1. Format: Subject is just the first name with a question mark. Body is nine words or fewer.
