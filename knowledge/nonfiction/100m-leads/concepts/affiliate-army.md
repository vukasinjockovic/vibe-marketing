## Summary
A six-step process for building an affiliate program: (1) Find ideal affiliates (who already has your audience?), (2) Make them an offer using the Core Four, (3) Qualify them (are they customers? can they execute the Core Four?), (4) Set pay structure (CPA, revenue share, or hybrid), (5) Launch with Whisper-Tease-Shout, (6) Integrate (give away lead magnet free, sell lead magnet, or sell core offer directly).

## Key Findings
1. Best affiliates are people who already have access to your target audience.

## Key Quotes
> "Like referrals, affiliates aren't an advertising method you can 'do.' They're people who advertise your stuff to benefit you both."
