**Aliases:** Callout Value CTA, Ad Formula, Three-Part Ad Structure

## Summary
Every paid ad has three parts: Callout (who this is for), Value (what they get), and CTA (what to do next). The Callout uses verbal methods (Labels, Yes-Questions, If-Then Statements) or visual methods (Contrast, Likeness, Scene). The Value section uses the What-Who-When framework. The CTA specifies the exact action plus reasons to act now.

## Key Findings
1. Verbal callouts: Labels ("Attention [avatar]!"), Yes-Questions ("Do you [pain]?"), If-Then ("If you [situation], then [promise]").
