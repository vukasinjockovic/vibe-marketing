# Constraint Finding
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Find the Constraint, Bottleneck Analysis, Biggest Drop-Off

## Summary
The diagnostic process for identifying which step in an advertising process is limiting total output. Measure conversion/throughput at each step, find the step with the biggest drop-off (the constraint), and focus all testing on improving only that step. Fixing non-constraints does not improve total output. This is the "Better" implementation in the More Better New framework.

## Key Findings
1. The constraint is always the step with the biggest drop-off in the process.

2. Fixing something that is not the constraint does not change total output.

3. Test one variable per week to improve the constraint. When fixed, find the next constraint.
