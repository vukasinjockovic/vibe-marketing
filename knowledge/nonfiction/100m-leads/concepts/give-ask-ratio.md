**Aliases:** Give to Ask Ratio, Content Ratio, Give-Ask Cadence

## Summary
The ratio of value-giving content to sales-asking content. Minimum viable ratio is 3:1 (three give posts for every ask post). Ideal is much higher -- "give until they ask." The concept prevents audience burnout from excessive pitching and builds the goodwill that makes asks effective when they do happen.

## Key Findings
1. Minimum 3:1 give-to-ask ratio, with higher being better.
