# Rule of 100
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Rule of 100, 100/day Rule, Primary Actions Rule

## Summary
A volume commitment framework: perform 100 primary actions per day for 100 days before judging whether an advertising method works. For outreach, that means 100 contacts per day. For content, 100 minutes of creation per day. For paid ads, $100/day in spend. The rule exists because most people dramatically underestimate the volume required and quit before reaching statistically meaningful sample sizes.

## Key Findings
1. 100 primary actions per day is the minimum viable volume for any Core Four method.

2. Most people do 1/100th or 1/1000th of required volume and conclude the method doesn't work.
