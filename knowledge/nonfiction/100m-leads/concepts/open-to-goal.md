# Open to Goal
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Open-to-Goal, Outcome-Based Work, Goal-Based Schedule

## Summary
An advanced work schedule where you commit to achieving a specific outcome each day rather than working a specific number of hours or performing a specific number of actions. If you achieve the goal by lunch, you can stop. If it takes 18 hours, so be it. This is the "big kid" version of Rule of 100 -- you commit to results, not just activity.

## Key Findings
1. Originated from a gym chain that let sales managers set their own schedule if they signed up 5 new members per day.

2. Hormozi pairs Open to Goal with: wake early (4-5am), get right to work (no rituals), no meetings until noon.

> "Do more than they do, and you will have more than they have."
