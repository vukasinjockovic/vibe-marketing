**Aliases:** Mastermind Story, Permission to Fail, Testing Budget Revelation

## Summary
Hormozi attended a private mastermind for eight-figure entrepreneurs (which he wasn't yet). A speaker making $3M/month casually mentioned that he allocates a percentage of revenue to test new campaigns, channels, and ideas without expecting a return -- "an investment in your education." This gave Hormozi "permission to fail." He tripled his ad budget the next week and grew from $400K to $780K/month.

## What It Illustrates
1. Setting aside a testing budget with no expected return is an investment in learning, not a cost.
