**Aliases:** Flyer Story, Volume Lesson, 300 vs 5000

## Summary
Hormozi put out 300 flyers for his gym and got zero leads. He called his mentor who revealed he tests with 5,000 flyers per day. At 0.5-1% response rate, 300 flyers would yield only 1.5 people -- statistically meaningless. The story crystallized the lesson that volume is almost always the problem, not the method. Hormozi was doing 1/1500th the required effort.

## What It Illustrates
1. Most people dramatically underestimate the volume required for advertising to work.

2. Small sample sizes make it impossible to evaluate any advertising method.

## Key Quotes
