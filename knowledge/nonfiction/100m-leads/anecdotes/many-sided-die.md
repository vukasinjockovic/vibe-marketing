## Summary
A parable Hormozi uses to close the book. Two players get dice with different numbers of sides (20 and 200), each with only one green side. Rules: you can't see how many sides you have; green rolls turn another red side green; the game ends when you stop rolling. One player keeps rolling and hits a green streak. The other compares, complains, and quits. Moral: the die you're given doesn't matter if you roll enough times. Every die hits its green streak when rolled enough times.
