**Author:** David Ogilvy

## On the Purpose of Advertising

> "I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information."

> "When Aeschines spoke, they said, 'How well he speaks.' But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, 'Let us march against Philip.'"

> "If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative."

> "Advertising is only evil when it advertises evil things."

## On the Consumer

> "The consumer is not a moron, she is your wife."

> "You cannot bore people into buying your product. You can only interest them in buying it."

> "Do not address your readers as though they were gathered together in a stadium. When people read your copy, they are alone. Pretend you are writing each of them a letter."

## On Headlines

> "On the average, five times as many people read the headlines as read the body copy. It follows that unless your headline sells your product, you have wasted 90 per cent of your money."

> "Advertising which promises no benefit to the consumer does not sell, yet the majority of campaigns contain no promise whatever. (That is the most important sentence in this book. Read it again.)"

> "Some copywriters write tricky headlines -- double meanings, puns and other obscurities. This is counter-productive."

## On Brand Image

> "Products, like people, have personalities, and they can make or break them in the market place."

> "Give people a taste of Old Crow, and tell them it's Old Crow. Then give them another taste of Old Crow, but tell them it's Jack Daniel's. Ask them which they prefer. They'll think the two drinks are quite different. They are tasting images."

> "Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the brand image."

> "The brand image is 90 per cent of what the distiller has to sell."

## On Big Ideas and Creativity

> "You can do homework from now until doomsday, but you will never win fame and fortune unless you also invent big ideas."

> "Big ideas come from the unconscious. This is true in art, in science and in advertising. But your unconscious has to be well informed."

> "I doubt if more than one campaign in a hundred contains a big idea."

## On Research and Homework

> "Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."

> "The more you know about it, the more likely you are to come up with a big idea for selling it."

> "If you are too lazy to do this kind of homework, you may occasionally luck into a successful campaign, but you will run the risk of skidding about on what my brother Francis called 'the slippery surface of irrelevant brilliance.'"

## On Copy

> "All my experience says that for a great many products, long copy sells more than short."

> "The more facts you tell, the more you sell."

> "Specifics work better than generalities."

> "Stay away from superlatives like 'Our product is the best in the world.' Gallup calls this Brag and Boast. It convinces nobody."

## On Repetition and Longevity

> "You aren't advertising to a standing army; you are advertising to a moving parade."

> "If you are lucky enough to write a good advertisement, repeat it until it stops selling."

> "Scores of good advertisements have been discarded before they lost their potency."

## On Products

> "Whenever you can, make the product itself the hero of your advertising. If you think the product too dull, I have news for you: there are no dull products, only dull writers."

> "It is often charged that advertising can persuade people to buy inferior products. So it can -- once. But the consumer perceives that the product is inferior and never buys it again."

## On Typography and Design

> "If you start your body copy with a drop-initial, you increase readership by an average of 13 per cent."

> "It is almost impossible to read" (on reverse type).

> "Periods are also called full stops, because they stop the reader dead in his tracks." (on not using periods in headlines)

## On Agencies and Careers

> "Search the parks in all your cities / You'll find no statues of committees."

> "Suppose your gall-bladder has to be removed this evening. Will you choose a surgeon who has read some books on anatomy and knows where to find your gall-bladder, or a surgeon who relies on his intuition?"

## On Positioning

> "I could have positioned Dove as a detergent bar for men with dirty hands, but chose instead to position it as a toilet bar for women with dry skin."

## On Promotions vs. Advertising

> "The manufacturer who finds himself up the creek is the short-sighted opportunist who siphons off his advertising dollars for short-term promotions."

## On Television

> "When you advertise fire-extinguishers, open with the fire."

> "Research shows that it is more difficult to hold your audience if you use voice-over. It is better to have the actors talk on camera."

## On the Giants

> "There is an inherent drama in every product. Our No. 1 job is to dig for it and capitalize on it." -- Leo Burnett

> "Advertising has a responsibility to behave properly." -- Raymond Rubicam
