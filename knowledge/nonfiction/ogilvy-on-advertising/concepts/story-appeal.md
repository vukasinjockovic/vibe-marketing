## Summary
A concept from researcher Harold Rudolph, adopted by Ogilvy as a key principle for visual advertising: photographs that arouse the reader's curiosity ("What goes on here?") dramatically outperform static product shots. The more "story appeal" injected into photographs, the more people look at advertisements. This insight led directly to the iconic Hathaway "man with the eyepatch" campaign.

## Key Findings
1. Harold Rudolph demonstrated that photographs with "story appeal" were far above average in attracting attention.

3. The principle works because curiosity-arousing images make readers ask "What goes on here?" which pulls them into the advertisement.
