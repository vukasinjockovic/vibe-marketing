**Aliases:** moving parade, advertising to a moving parade, standing army vs moving parade

## Summary
Ogilvy's metaphor for why good advertising should be repeated rather than replaced: you are not advertising to a fixed audience (standing army) but to a constantly changing stream of new prospects entering the market (moving parade). The ad that sold a refrigerator to last year's newlyweds will work equally well for this year's. This principle argues against the common mistake of changing campaigns too soon.

## Key Findings
1. Research shows readership of an advertisement does not decline when run several times in the same magazine -- remains at same level through at least four repetitions.

2. Scores of good advertisements have been discarded before they lost their potency.
