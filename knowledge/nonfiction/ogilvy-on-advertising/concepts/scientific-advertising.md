## Summary
Claude Hopkins' book and method that Ogilvy credits with changing the course of his life. The core idea: advertising decisions should be based on testing and measurement, not opinion or intuition. Hopkins invented test marketing, sampling by coupon, and copy research. Ogilvy adopted and extended this empirical tradition, becoming the bridge between Hopkins' hard-sell testing approach and modern research-driven advertising.

## Key Findings
1. Hopkins' Scientific Advertising "changed the course of my life" by curing Ogilvy of "pseudo-literary pretentions."

## Key Quotes
> "Almost any question can be answered, cheaply, quickly and finally, by a test campaign. And that's the way to answer them -- not by arguments around the table."

> "Ad writers forget they are salesmen and try to be performers. Instead of sales, they seek applause."
