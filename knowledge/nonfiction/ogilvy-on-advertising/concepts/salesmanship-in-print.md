**Aliases:** salesmanship in print, advertising as selling, medium of information

## Summary
The foundational definition of advertising that Ogilvy adopted from John E. Kennedy (via Albert Lasker): advertising is "salesmanship in print." Ogilvy extended this to mean that advertising is a medium of information, not entertainment or art. The purpose of every advertisement is to sell, not to win awards or entertain. This principle governs all of Ogilvy's work and is the lens through which he evaluates all advertising.

## Key Findings
1. John E. Kennedy, a Canadian policeman turned copywriter, defined advertising as "salesmanship in print" -- a definition Lasker said "has never been improved."

2. Ogilvy frames the principle through the Demosthenes/Aeschines contrast: good advertising makes people act, not admire the speaker.

3. "Of 81 television classics picked by the Clio festival in previous years, 36 of the agencies involved had either lost the account or gone out of business."
