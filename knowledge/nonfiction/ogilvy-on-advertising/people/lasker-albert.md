## Summary
Head of Lord & Thomas agency for 44 years (bought it at age 20), Lasker made more money than anyone in advertising history. He adopted John E. Kennedy's definition of advertising as "salesmanship in print" and built his agency on it. He dispensed with marketers, art directors, and researchers, achieving a profit margin of 7% (the world record). He ran the agency as a dictatorship, hired Claude Hopkins at $185,000/year, and trained so many leaders that at one point the heads of nine major agencies were Lasker alumni.
