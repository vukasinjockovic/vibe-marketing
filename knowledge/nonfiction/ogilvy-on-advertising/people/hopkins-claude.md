## Summary
Author of Scientific Advertising, which Ogilvy credits with changing the course of his life. Hopkins invented test marketing, sampling by coupon, and copy research. A prodigiously hard worker who seldom left his office before the early hours, he was paid $185,000/year by Lasker at Lord & Thomas (equivalent to $2,000,000 in Ogilvy's 1983 dollars). He created campaigns for Pepsodent, Palmolive, Schlitz Beer, and six different cars. Though remembered as a "hard sell" advocate, he also perceived the importance of brand images a generation before the term came into use.

## Key Findings
1. Invented test marketing, sampling by coupon, and copy research.
   -- Source: Ogilvy on Advertising, Ch.18

2. His book Scientific Advertising is Ogilvy's essential text: "Nobody should be allowed to have anything to do with advertising until he has read this book seven times."
   -- Source: Ogilvy on Advertising, Ch.18

3. Perceived the importance of brand images before the term existed: "Try to give each advertiser a becoming style. To create the right individuality is a supreme accomplishment."
   -- Source: Ogilvy on Advertising, Ch.18

4. Was wrong about one thing: "People using your product are not going to read your ads" -- later research showed users read ads more than non-users.
