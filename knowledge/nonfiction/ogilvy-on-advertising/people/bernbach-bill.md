## Summary
Co-founder of Doyle Dane Bernbach, started in the same year as Ogilvy (1949). Bernbach was "a gentleman with brains" who worshipped at the altar of originality and integrated copy with illustration. His VW and Avis campaigns are among the greatest in advertising history. He denounced research as the enemy of creativity, always insisted advertising make the product the hero, and believed human nature hasn't changed for a billion years. He ran his agency with rare self-discipline, never staying past five or working weekends.
