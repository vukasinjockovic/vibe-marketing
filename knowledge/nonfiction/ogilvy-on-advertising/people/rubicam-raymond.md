## Summary
Co-founder of Young & Rubicam (now one of the biggest agencies in the world), Ogilvy's personal hero for 40 years. Rubicam was the first to make research part of the creative process, hiring George Gallup from Northwestern to measure ad readership. His copy chief Roy Whittier articulated: "In advertising, the beginning of greatness is to be different, and the beginning of failure is to be the same." Rubicam proved "you can sell products without bamboozling the American public" and taught Ogilvy that "advertising has a responsibility to behave properly."
