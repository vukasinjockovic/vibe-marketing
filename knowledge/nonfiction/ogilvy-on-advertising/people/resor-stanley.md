## Summary
Head of J. Walter Thompson for 45 years, growing it from $3M to $500M in billings -- the biggest agency in the world. The "Brahmin of advertising" -- austere, dignified, cultured. His secret was attracting exceptional talent and treating them with such respect they never left. A fervent believer in research (unlike Lasker), he set up a 5,000-consumer panel, a test kitchen, and early TV experiments. He was the first to employ women as copywriters (starting with his wife Helen) and the first to build an international office network.
