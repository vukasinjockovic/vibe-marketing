## Summary
Leader of the "Chicago school" of advertising, which was his invention. Started his agency in Chicago in 1935 at age 44, but didn't hit his stride until 60. By death at 80, his agency was the biggest in the world outside New York. His greatest monument is the Marlboro cowboy campaign, which took the brand from obscurity to the world's biggest-selling cigarette and ran 25+ years. He believed in "inherent drama" in every product and kept a "Corny Language" folder of earthy, vernacular phrases on his desk.

(2) "When you reach for the stars, you may not quite get one, but you won't come up with a handful of mud either." (3) "Steep yourself in your subject, work like hell, and love, honor and obey your hunches."
