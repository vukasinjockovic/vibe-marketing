**Aliases:** Rolls-Royce ad, electric clock headline, At 60 miles an hour

## Summary
Ogilvy's most famous advertisement, created after three weeks of product research reading about the Rolls-Royce. The headline -- "At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock" -- was discovered in technical literature, not invented. The ad ran in only two newspapers and two magazines for $25,000, followed by 607 words of factual copy with 13 numbered details. It became the archetype of the factual long-copy formula. Ford subsequently based their multi-million dollar campaign on claiming their car was even quieter.

## What It Illustrates
1. The power of homework/research: the headline came from reading, not creative brainstorming.
