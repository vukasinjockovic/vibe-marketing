## Summary
Created by Doyle Dane Bernbach (Bill Bernbach, copywriter Julian Koenig, art director Helmut Krone). Positioned VW as a protest against Detroit's vulgarity, making the Beetle a cult among non-conformists. Sales rose to 500,000 cars a year. Ogilvy considered it one of the greatest positioning campaigns ever, demonstrating how cultural positioning could transform a physically unappealing product into a desirable one.

## What It Illustrates
1. Cultural positioning: the car was positioned as an anti-establishment statement, not on features.

2. Honesty as strategy: "Think Small" and "Lemon" were self-deprecating, which built trust.

## Key Quotes
