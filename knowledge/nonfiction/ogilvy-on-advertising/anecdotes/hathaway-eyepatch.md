## Summary
One of Ogilvy's signature campaigns, inspired by Harold Rudolph's research on "story appeal" in photographs. The eyepatch gave the model (Baron Wrangell) a mysterious narrative quality that made readers ask "What goes on here?" First appeared in 1951 and was "still going strong" decades later. The campaign demonstrated that adding a single element of curiosity to an otherwise conventional photograph could transform advertising effectiveness.

## What It Illustrates
1. Story appeal: a single mysterious element (the eyepatch) aroused enormous curiosity and dramatically increased attention.
