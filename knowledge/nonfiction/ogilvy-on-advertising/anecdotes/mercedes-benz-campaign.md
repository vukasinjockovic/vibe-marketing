## Summary
After losing the Rolls-Royce account (resigned when they sent 500 defective cars to the US), Ogilvy took on Mercedes-Benz. He sent a team to Stuttgart for three weeks of taped interviews with engineers. The resulting campaign of long, factual advertisements increased Mercedes sales in the United States from 10,000 cars a year to 40,000 -- a 4x increase achieved through the same factual long-copy approach that worked for Rolls-Royce.
