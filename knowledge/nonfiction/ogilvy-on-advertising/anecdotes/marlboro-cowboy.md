## Summary
Created by Leo Burnett. Took Marlboro from obscurity to the biggest-selling cigarette in the world through a single, consistent brand image -- the cowboy. The campaign ran for 25+ years without fundamental change, making it one of the most durable brand image campaigns in advertising history. Ogilvy cites it as the ultimate proof that brand image, not product features, determines market success.
