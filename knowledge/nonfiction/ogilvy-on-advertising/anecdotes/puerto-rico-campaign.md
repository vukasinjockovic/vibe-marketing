# Puerto Rico Economic Development Campaign
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Puerto Rico campaign, Puerto Rico advertising, Operation Bootstrap advertising

## Summary
Ogilvy's first Puerto Rico ad contained 600 words of copy. Fourteen thousand readers sent in the coupon, and scores of them built factories in Puerto Rico. Research changed the island's image from "dirty, ugly and squalid" to "beautiful and romantic." The campaign demonstrates that long-copy advertising with coupons can drive economic transformation, not just product sales.

## What It Illustrates
1. Long copy works for complex propositions: 600 words generated 14,000 coupon responses.

3. Advertising serves social good: attracted industry to a country "living on the edge of starvation for 400 years."
