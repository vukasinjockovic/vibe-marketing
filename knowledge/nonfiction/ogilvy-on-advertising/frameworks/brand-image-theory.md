## Summary
Ogilvy's framework that products, like people, have personalities, and every advertisement should be treated as a long-term contribution to the brand's image. The brand image -- not the physical product -- is what consumers actually buy, especially for products whose brand is visible to others (beer, cigarettes, cars). Ogilvy popularized this concept in 1953, though he acknowledges Claude Hopkins described it a generation earlier.

## Key Findings
1. Products have personalities that can make or break them in the marketplace; brand image is an amalgam of name, packaging, price, advertising style, and product nature.

2. Consumers "taste images" -- blind taste tests show people cannot distinguish products, but when told the brand name, they perceive significant taste differences.

3. For whiskey, "the brand image is 90 per cent of what the distiller has to sell."

4. It pays to give most products "an image of quality -- a First Class ticket," especially for products visible to friends.
