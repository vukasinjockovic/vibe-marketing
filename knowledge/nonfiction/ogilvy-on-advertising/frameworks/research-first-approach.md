## Summary
Ogilvy's foundational workflow principle: before writing a single word of advertising, the copywriter must do exhaustive homework. This includes studying the product (often for weeks), studying competitor advertising, researching consumers (their language, desires, concerns), deciding positioning, deciding brand image, and then searching for the Big Idea. Ogilvy considers advertising people who ignore research "as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."

## Key Findings
