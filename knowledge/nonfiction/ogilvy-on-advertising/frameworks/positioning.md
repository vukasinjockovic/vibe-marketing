## Summary
Ogilvy's framework for defining what a product does and who it is for, which must be decided before any advertising is written. Positioning is the strategic choice that determines everything downstream -- brand image, headline, copy approach. Ogilvy demonstrated its power through his Dove positioning (toilet bar for women with dry skin, not detergent bar for dirty hands) which ran successfully for 25+ years.

## Key Findings
