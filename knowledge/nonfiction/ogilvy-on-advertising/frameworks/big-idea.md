# The Big Idea
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Big Idea, big idea test, five questions test

## Summary
Ogilvy's central creative framework: advertising succeeds or fails based on whether it contains a "Big Idea" -- a concept so compelling it can run for decades and sell products through multiple business cycles. Big ideas come from the unconscious mind after intensive conscious preparation, and can be validated against five specific criteria.

## Key Findings
1. Only about 1 in 100 campaigns contains a big idea.

2. Big ideas come from the unconscious mind, but the unconscious must be "well informed" through exhaustive homework first.
   -- Source: Ogilvy on Advertising, Ch.2

3. A big idea is validated by five questions: (1) Did it make me gasp? (2) Do I wish I had thought of it? (3) Is it unique? (4) Does it fit the strategy perfectly? (5) Could it be used for 30 years?

## Key Quotes
> "You can do homework from now until doomsday, but you will never win fame and fortune unless you also invent big ideas. It takes a big idea to attract the attention of consumers and get them to buy your product. Unless your advertising contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night."

> "I doubt if more than one campaign in a hundred contains a big idea."

> "Big ideas come from the unconscious. This is true in art, in science and in advertising. But your unconscious has to be well informed, or your idea will be irrelevant. Stuff your conscious mind with information, then unhook your rational thought process."
