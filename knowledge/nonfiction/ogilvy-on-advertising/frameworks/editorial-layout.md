## Summary
Ogilvy's layout framework prescribing that advertisements should mimic editorial content rather than look like advertisements. Research showed roughly six times as many people read the average article as the average advertisement. The framework specifies: illustration at top, headline below, copy in three columns of 35-45 characters in serif type, captions on every image, drop-initials, black type on white background.
