## Summary
According to Brunson, all businesses ultimately serve one of three core markets (also called core desires): Health, Wealth, and Relationships. Each core market contains submarkets, and each submarket contains niches. The expert's job is to find their niche within a submarket and create a new category within it, becoming the category king. This hierarchy determines positioning, audience identification, and competitive strategy.

## Key Findings
1. Three core markets: Health (fitness, nutrition, physical well-being), Wealth (money, business, career, investments), Relationships (love, family, social connections).
