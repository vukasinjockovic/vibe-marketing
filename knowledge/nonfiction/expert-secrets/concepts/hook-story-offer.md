**Aliases:** HSO Framework, Hook Story Offer

## Summary
Brunson's meta-framework for all marketing content: every piece of content (ads, emails, landing pages, social posts, webinars, sales pages) contains three elements: a Hook (grabs attention), a Story (builds perceived value), and an Offer (what you're selling). If something isn't working in a funnel, it is always one of these three elements. This framework was introduced at Funnel Hacking LIVE as the most important discovery of Brunson's 15+ year career, though he credits DotCom Secrets as the primary source.

## Key Findings
1. Every page in a funnel has a hook, story, and offer -- from ads to upsell pages.

2. If something isn't working, diagnose which element is failing: hook, story, or offer.

3. Expert Secrets primarily teaches the "Story" element; DotCom Secrets teaches the structural "Offer" element.
