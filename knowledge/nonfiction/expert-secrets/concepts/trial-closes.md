**Aliases:** Trial Close Technique, Habit of Agreement, Yes-Questions

## Summary
Trial closes are simple yes-or-no questions sprinkled throughout a presentation where the only logical answer is "yes." They create a "habit of agreement" so that when the actual money ask comes, the prospect has already said yes hundreds of times. Taught to Brunson by Ted Thomas ("The Pied Piper of Selling"). Adding trial closes to an existing automated webinar increased Brunson's revenue per registrant from $9.45 to $16.50 -- a 75% increase with no other changes.

## Key Findings
1. The technique creates involuntary head-nodding in the audience ("waves in the ocean").

2. Trial closes should be used after every case study, success story, or teaching point.

3. The most powerful placement is right after sharing a success story: "Did you hear that? Isn't that amazing? Can you imagine what your life would be like?"

## Key Quotes
> "The reason I didn't get a table rush was because the first time I asked the audience to say yes was when I was asking for their money."
