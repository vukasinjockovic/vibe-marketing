## Summary
False beliefs are the stories people tell themselves that prevent them from taking action. In Brunson's framework, they form through a chain: Experience -> Story -> Belief. Every prospect carries three categories of false belief: (1) Vehicle beliefs ("this approach won't work"), (2) Internal beliefs ("I can't do this"), and (3) External beliefs ("something outside me will stop me"). The job of marketing is NOT to argue against these beliefs but to rewrite the underlying stories through Epiphany Bridge narratives. Each of the Perfect Webinar's Three Secrets targets one belief category.

## Key Findings
1. Beliefs form through a predictable chain: experience creates a story, the story becomes a belief, the belief drives behavior.

2. Three categories must all be addressed: vehicle (new opportunity), internal (their ability), external (outside forces).

3. Stories rewrite beliefs; arguments trigger resistance. "If I can identify people's false beliefs and tell stories that show them the truth, I don't need to sell them anything."

4. The false belief rewriting process: Identify false belief -> Find the experience that created it -> Name the story they tell themselves -> Create a new Epiphany Bridge story that replaces it.

## Key Quotes
> "Our only real goal in any of our marketing is to identify the false beliefs and false stories our customers are telling themselves -- the ones that are keeping them from success -- and to rewrite these stories inside their minds."

> "The stories you believe will form your identity and shape the direction of your life. If you change the stories you believe, you can create an identity shift."
