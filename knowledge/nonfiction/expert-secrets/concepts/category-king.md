## Summary
The Category King concept, drawn from the book "Play Bigger" by Al Ramadan et al., states that the dominant player in any market category captures 70-80% of profits. Brunson applies this to expert positioning: instead of competing in an existing niche (red ocean), create your own sub-niche/category where you are automatically the king. This is achieved by combining the New Opportunity framework with proprietary frameworks and a unique positioning statement.
