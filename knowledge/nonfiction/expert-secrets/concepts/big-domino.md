# Big Domino (The One Thing)
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** The One Thing, Big Domino Statement, Single Point of Belief

## Summary
The Big Domino is the single belief that, if the prospect accepts it, makes all other objections irrelevant. It is the foundational concept of the Perfect Webinar: every element of the presentation exists to support this ONE belief from different angles. Based on the logical form modus ponens (If A then B; A; therefore B), the Big Domino statement follows the formula: "If I can make them believe that [new opportunity] is the key to [desired result] and is only attainable through [my vehicle], then all other objections become irrelevant." Perry Belcher discovered that each additional belief point in a sales message cuts conversion by half.
