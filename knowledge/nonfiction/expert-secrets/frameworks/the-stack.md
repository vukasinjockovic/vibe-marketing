## Summary
The Stack is a closing technique taught to Brunson by Armand Morin. Instead of presenting offer elements one at a time (where the prospect only remembers the last bonus), you build them cumulatively on a single slide. Each new element is added with its individual value, and the cumulative total grows visibly. The last thing the prospect sees is the COMPLETE offer with FULL value, making the actual price feel like a massive discount. Brunson credits the Stack as the single technique that has made him more money than anything else in business.

## Key Findings
1. People only remember the last thing you show them. If the last thing is a small bonus, they anchor to that value.

2. The total value on the Stack Slide should be approximately 10x the actual price.

3. Between each new element, tell the story of how you created it (learned/earned) to increase perceived value.
