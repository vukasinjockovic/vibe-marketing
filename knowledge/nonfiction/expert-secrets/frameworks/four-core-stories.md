**Aliases:** The Four Stories, Core Story Framework, False Belief Stories

## Summary
The Four Core Stories are the minimum set of Epiphany Bridge stories needed for any sales presentation. Each story targets a different layer of false belief that prevents the prospect from buying. They are: (1) Origin Story (new opportunity), (2) Vehicle Framework Story, (3) Internal Beliefs Story, (4) External Beliefs Story. Together, they systematically dismantle every category of resistance a prospect can have. The framework is the narrative backbone of the Perfect Webinar's "Three Secrets" section.

## Key Findings
1. Story #1 (Origin) breaks beliefs about the old vehicle/opportunity. After hearing it, the prospect should believe the new opportunity is the path to their desired result.

2. Story #2 (Vehicle) breaks false beliefs about the specific framework/method. After hearing it, the prospect should believe this particular approach works.

4. Story #4 (External) breaks beliefs about outside forces. After hearing it, the prospect should believe nothing external will stop them.

## Key Quotes
> "Each story I share with my audience has a very specific purpose. It's to break a false belief that they may have and rewrite it with a new empowering belief."

> "If I can identify people's false beliefs and tell stories that show them the truth, I don't need to 'sell' them anything."
