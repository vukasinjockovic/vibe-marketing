# New Opportunity Framework
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Opportunity Switch, New Opportunity vs Improvement Offer

## Summary
The New Opportunity is Brunson's positioning framework for offers. The core principle: never sell an improvement on what the prospect already does. Instead, create a completely new opportunity that replaces their current vehicle. Improvement offers fail because they require the prospect to admit their current approach failed (decreasing status). New Opportunities create hope and excitement without judgment. This applies to the front of the value ladder (opportunity switch) and ascending the ladder (opportunity stacking).

## Key Findings
1. Improvement offers decrease perceived status because they force admission of past failure.

2. Status is the #1 driver of all purchasing decisions: "Will this increase or decrease my perceived status?"

3. There should be ONE opportunity switch (at the front-end offer). Ascending the value ladder uses opportunity stacking (adding tools within the same opportunity).
