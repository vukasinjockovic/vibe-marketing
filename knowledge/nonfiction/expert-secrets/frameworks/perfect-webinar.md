## Summary
The Perfect Webinar is Brunson's master framework for one-to-many selling presentations. It is a 43-slide, 90-minute structure with three phases: The Big Domino (15 min), The Three Secrets (45 min), and The Stack & Closes (30 min). The framework is designed to break three layers of false beliefs (vehicle, internal, external) and present an irresistible offer using value stacking. Brunson reports this is the single most valuable framework he has ever created, and it works for live stage, webinar, VSL, Facebook Live, and automated presentations.

## Key Findings
1. The three-phase structure maintains consistent time ratios (1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 2/6) regardless of total presentation length.

2. The content section (Three Secrets) teaches strategy (what) but never tactics (how). Teaching tactics kills sales.

3. The Stack portion uses Armand Morin's technique of cumulative value display on one slide.
