## Summary
The Epiphany Bridge is Russell Brunson's core storytelling framework for persuasive selling. It is a 5-phase, 14-question story structure that guides the teller through backstory, journey/conflict, new opportunity, framework, and achievement/transformation. The framework is designed to give the listener the same emotional epiphany the teller experienced, causing them to adopt a new belief and abandon their old one. It is the central narrative technique in Expert Secrets and is used in ads, emails, webinars, podcasts, VSLs, and stage presentations.

## Key Findings
1. The framework has 5 phases and 14 questions that can be expanded or compressed to fit any time constraint (30 seconds to 2 hours).

2. Built on the Hero's Two Journeys (Campbell -> Vogler -> Hauge -> Brunson), adapted specifically for selling contexts rather than film or mythology.

3. Every story must resolve BOTH the external journey (achievement) and the internal journey (transformation).

4. The purpose is to break false beliefs by giving the listener a new epiphany, not to present logical arguments.
