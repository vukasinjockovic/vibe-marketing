**Aliases:** Two Journeys, Achievement and Transformation, Hero's Journey (Brunson adaptation)

## Summary
Brunson's adaptation of Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey (via Christopher Vogler and Michael Hauge) that simplifies story structure for marketing and selling. The key insight is that every hero has TWO simultaneous journeys: the Journey of Achievement (external, visible goal) and the Journey of Transformation (internal, identity change). The transformation journey is what creates lasting emotional connection. Brunson distilled this into a 4-phase framework: Backstory, Journey/Conflict, Mentor/Guide, Achievement/Transformation.

## Key Findings
1. The Journey of Achievement drives the story forward, but the Journey of Transformation is what actually matters.

2. Rocky didn't beat Apollo Creed, Lightning McQueen didn't win the Piston Cup -- but both transformed. The second journey is the real story.

3. Four phases: Backstory (build rapport + introduce desire), Journey/Conflict (villain creates stakes), Mentor/Guide (epiphany + frameworks), Achievement/Transformation (both journeys resolved).

4. Building rapport requires giving the hero at least 2 of 5 qualities: victim, in jeopardy, likable, funny, powerful.
