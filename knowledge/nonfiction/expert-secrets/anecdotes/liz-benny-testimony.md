## Summary
At Brunson's final Inner Circle meeting (before pausing the program), member Liz Benny from New Zealand stood up and shared how she initially was annoyed by Brunson's ads ("Who is this 12-year-old kid?"), eventually clicked, bought a book, watched videos, joined the Inner Circle by wiring $25,000 she didn't have, and over five years built a global brand. This story serves as the emotional capstone of Expert Secrets and illustrates the full customer journey: from ad skeptic to lifelong customer to transformed person.
