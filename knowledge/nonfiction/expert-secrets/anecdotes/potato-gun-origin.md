## Summary
Brunson's signature origin story and the primary example of the Epiphany Bridge script in action. As a college wrestler who couldn't get a job due to NCAA regulations, Brunson wanted to support his wife. He created a DVD about making potato guns and sold it online via Google ads at $37/day. When Google raised ad costs, his business died. Mike Filsaime told him about upsells (like McDonald's asking "would you like fries?"). Brunson added a potato gun kit as an upsell -- 1 in 3 buyers took it -- creating his first funnel. This epiphany led to discovering that the secret to online success wasn't what you sell, but how you sell it (through funnels).
