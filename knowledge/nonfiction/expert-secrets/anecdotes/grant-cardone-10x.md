## Summary
On February 23, 2018, Brunson spoke at Grant Cardone's 10X Event at Mandalay Bay to 9,000 attendees. He negotiated to speak for free in exchange for 50% of sales (rather than accept a speaking fee). Using the Perfect Webinar framework, he sold $3.2 million in 90 minutes, netting over $1 million per hour. This story serves as the opening of Section 3 and demonstrates the power of one-to-many selling at scale.

## What It Illustrates

## Key Quotes
> "Almost anyone could probably close a higher percentage than I could selling one-on-one, but because I'm able to speak to 100 people, or 1,000 people, or 9,000 people all at once, with one speech, and because I know how to craft and structure my presentation, I'm able to make more money in a fraction of the time!"
