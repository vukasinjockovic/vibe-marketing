## Summary
Webinar selling expert who contributed two key techniques to the Perfect Webinar framework: (1) the "single point of belief" principle that reinforced the Big Domino concept, and (2) the "You're probably thinking X, right?" objection blitz technique. During a joint webinar with Brunson, Fladlien spent 90 minutes after the main presentation breaking approximately 50 additional false beliefs, resulting in 3x more sales during the blitz than during the primary presentation.

## Key Findings
1. "The idea is to have a single point of belief that your message is built around and is emphasized over and over and over again from a variety of different angles."
