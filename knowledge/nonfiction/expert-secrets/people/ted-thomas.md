## Summary
Stage closer known as "The Pied Piper of Selling" because he could get hundreds of people to line up behind him, waving credit cards, and walk to the back of the room. He taught Brunson the trial close technique -- using dozens of simple yes-or-no questions throughout a presentation to create a "habit of agreement." This technique increased Brunson's automated webinar revenue from $9.45 to $16.50 per registrant (75% lift) with no other changes.

## Key Findings
1. Demonstrated trial closes by using them conversationally at lunch -- Brunson was nodding involuntarily the entire time.

2. Key insight: "The reason I didn't get a table rush was because the first time I asked the audience to say yes was when I was asking for their money."
