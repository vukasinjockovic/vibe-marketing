# Offer Variation Hierarchy (When Offers Fatigue)

## Overview

Offers fatigue over time. Local markets fatigue faster (smaller addressable radius).
But: "Reaching an audience one time in no way means an offer is fatigued."

Key insight: "We are not changing the actual offer. We are only changing the wrapping paper."

## The Hierarchy (Lightest to Heaviest)

Change these in order. Only go deeper when the lighter changes stop working.

### 1. Change the creative
Images, pictures, videos in your ads.
Lightest change. Do this first and repeatedly.

### 2. Change the body copy
The words in your ads (not the headline/offer name).

### 3. Change the headline (the "wrapper")
Rename the offer without changing the offer itself.
- "Free 6 Week Lean Challenge" --> "Free 6 Week Tone Challenge"
- "Holiday Hangover" --> "New Year New You"

### 4. Change the duration
6 weeks to 28 days or 8 weeks, etc.

### 5. Change the enhancer
The free/discount component of your offer.

### 6. Change the monetization structure (LAST RESORT)
The series of offers, price points, and business model.
"Change the entire machine behind it only as a last resort and for a darn good reason."

## Key Rules

- "Once you've monetized an offer, rarely should you change it."
- "Use your entrepreneurial ADD on the 'wrapper' first"
- Most of the time it's items 1-3 that need changing, repeatedly, without touching anything lower
- You can rotate between multiple "winning" offer names -- this is the "ultimate position of power"
- Test 2-3 names, note the winner, use that as control to test against

## Local Business Application

"Learning to rapidly variate my offers, headlines, and creative when I had my local businesses was a cornerstone skill."
Local offers fatigue faster because TAM is limited to the immediate radius.
"The smaller the radius, the faster offers fatigue."
