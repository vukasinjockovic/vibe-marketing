# Bonus Stacking Formula (The 11 Bonus Bullets)
Source: Alex Hormozi, "$100M Offers", Chapter 14

## Core Principle

"A single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses."

The mechanism: Anchor the price to the core offer. Each bonus widens the price-to-value discrepancy until "we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket."

## The 11 Bonus Bullets

For every bonus you present:

1. **Always offer them** -- use the bundled deliverables from your Trim & Stack
2. **Give a special name** with a benefit in the title
3. **Tell them:**
   - a) How it relates to their issue
   - b) What it is
   - c) How you discovered it, or what you had to do to create it
   - d) How it will improve their lives (faster, easier, less effort/sacrifice)
4. **Provide proof** -- a stat, past client story, or personal experience
5. **Paint a vivid mental image** of life with the benefit already experienced
6. **Ascribe a price tag** and justify it
7. **Prefer tools & checklists** over additional trainings (lower effort = higher value per the value equation)
8. **Address a specific obstacle** in the prospect's mind (prove their limiting belief incorrect)
9. **Solve the NEXT problem** before they encounter it (anticipate what they'll logically need next)
10. **Total bonus value must eclipse core offer value** -- subconsciously signals the core must be even more valuable
11. **Add scarcity/urgency to individual bonuses** -- bonuses on steroids

## Bonus Presentation Rules

### 1-on-1 Selling
- Ask for the sale FIRST, before revealing bonuses
- IF they say YES: reveal bonuses after sign-up (creates wow, reinforces decision)
- IF they say NO: present a bonus matching their specific objection, then ask again
- Layer bonuses one at a time for objection after objection -- reciprocity makes it hard to keep saying no

### Never Discount
"Whenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer."
Adding bonuses > cutting prices. Strength and goodwill > weakness.

## Ideal Bonus Types

**Create once, give forever:**
- Checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates
- Recorded workshops, webinars, events, interviews
- Information products (high perceived value, low cost, zero operational effort)
- Tickets to virtual experiences or events
- Trial of higher service level (also doubles as upsell mechanism)

**What qualifies as a bonus (vs core offer)?**
- Wow Factor: something you wouldn't want someone to miss
- Short in length but high in quality/value
- Can almost stand alone but gets lost in the mix otherwise
- Checklists/infographics that condense information into small space

## Advanced: Partner Bonuses

Get other businesses to contribute their products/services as bonuses:
- Free for them (it's marketing to your customer base)
- Free for you (high-value bonuses at no cost)
- Not direct competitors

Then also negotiate:
- Group discount for your customers
- Referral commission to yourself

Result: Bonuses become revenue streams AND justify the entire price.

## Enhancing Bonuses

### With Scarcity
"Only people who sign up for XYZ program will have access to Bonus #1, 2, 3 that are never for sale anywhere else."

### With Urgency
"If you buy today, I will add in XYZ bonus that normally costs $1,000, for free. Because I want to reward action takers."
