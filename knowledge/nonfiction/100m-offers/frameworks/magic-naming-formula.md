## Overview

A five-component naming formula for offers, programs, and services. Each letter corresponds to both a naming component and a marketing concept.

## Components

| Letter | Component | Marketing Concept |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **M** | Make a Magnetic "Reason Why" | Attention |
| **A** | Announce Your Avatar | Discrimination |
| **G** | Give Them a Goal | Purpose |
| **I** | Indicate a Time Interval | Timeline |
| **C** | Complete With a Container Word | Method |

## Usage Rules

- Use 3-5 components per name (not all are mandatory)
- Components do NOT need to be in M-A-G-I-C order -- use what sounds punchiest
- The shorter and punchier the better -- balance brevity with specificity
- The only way to know what works is to write names out and test them
- Apply to main offer AND to each bonus/sub-item

## Component Details

### M - Magnetic "Reason Why"
Answers: Why this offer? OR What's in it for me?
Examples: Free, 88% off, Giveaway, Spring, Summer, Back To School, Grand Opening, New Management, Anniversary, Halloween, New Year

### A - Avatar
Call out the ideal prospect (and repel the wrong ones). Be hyper-specific and hyper-local.
Examples: Bee Cave Dentists, Rolling Hills Moms, Brick & Mortar Businesses, Brooklyn Busy Executives

### G - Goal
Dream outcome as a specific, tangible word or phrase.
Examples: Pain Free, Celebrity Smile, Double Your Profit, First Client, Little Black Dress

### C - Container Word
Denotes a system/bundle that can't be compared to commoditized alternatives.
Examples: Challenge, Blueprint, Bootcamp, Intensive, Masterclass, Accelerator, Fast Track, Sprint, System, Deep Dive, Workshop, Reset, Hack
