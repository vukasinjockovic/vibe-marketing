## Overview

Scarcity = a function of QUANTITY (vs urgency which is a function of time).
Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain.

## The Three Types

### 1. Limited Supply of Seats/Slots
Fixed number available, either total or per time period.

**For Physical Products:** Limited releases (flavors, colors, designs, sizes)
- Always sell out (plan below demand)
- Monthly cadence is the sweet spot
- Always announce sold-out status

**For Services (4 methods):**
- **Total Business Cap**: "Only servicing 25 customers total. Period."
- **Growth Rate Cap**: "Only accepting 5 new clients per week."
- **Cohort Cap**: "We take on 100 clients 4 times a year."
- **No-Return Policy**: "If you leave you can never return." (small groups only)

### 2. Limited Supply of Bonuses
Bonuses available only to a limited number of buyers or for a limited window.
- "Only people who sign up for XYZ program will have access"
- "I have 3 tickets left to my $5,000 event, if you buy this program..."

### 3. Never Available Again
One-time-only products/offers that will never be repeated.
- Limited edition physical products
- One-off events or experiences
- Specific vintage or batch items

## The Most Ethical Scarcity: Honesty

Define a real capacity number and share it.
"We are 81% to capacity" -- implies social proof AND creates urgency.
Only you get to draw where "full" is.

## Extreme Scarcity (Pro Tip)

Sell very limited 1-on-1 access, capped at a tiny number, priced very high.
Works via: DM access, email, phone, voice memo, Zoom.
"If you don't hate money, sell a very limited supply of 1-on-1 access."

## Key Rule

Always have LESS spots available than you think you can sell.
This is "a compounding strategy that increases in effectiveness over time."
