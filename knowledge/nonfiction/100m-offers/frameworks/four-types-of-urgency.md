## Overview

Urgency = a function of TIME (vs scarcity which is a function of quantity).
Limits WHEN people can sign up, not HOW MANY.

## The Four Types

### 1. Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency
Start clients on a regular cadence and use that as the urgency lever.

**Basic template:**
"If you sign up today, I can get you in with our next group that kicks off on Monday, otherwise you'll have to wait until our next kickoff date."

**Enhanced template:**
"I actually had a client drop out, so I have an opening for our next cohort that kicks off on Monday. If you're pretty sure you're gonna do this sooner or later, might as well get in on it now."

Rule: The less frequently you start new clients, the more powerful this is.

### 2. Rolling Seasonal Urgency
Rename the same promotion by season with real start/end dates.

Examples:
- New Year Promotion ends Jan 30!
- Valentines Lovers Promo ends Feb 28!
- Sexy By Spring Special ends March 31!

"The actual promotion may be the same, but naming it something different 'by season' gives you a real differentiator."

This is the #1 strategy for local businesses.

### 3. Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency
The promotion/deal itself is what they miss out on (not the service).

Template: "Let's get you started today so you can take advantage of the discount you came in for. I'm not sure how long we'll be running it as we change them every 4 weeks or so."

Interchangeable levers: pricing promotion, discount, free install, free onboarding, extra workshop.

### 4. Exploding Opportunity
For time-decaying arbitrage or market opportunities.

Every second someone delays, they miss out on disproportionate gains.
Used for: platform arbitrage, market inefficiencies, early-mover advantages.

## Key Insight: The Last-Day Phenomenon

"The biggest sales on a week-long campaign happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (up to 50-60%). The last 3% of time creates 50-60% of sales."

## Pipeline Cleaning Rule

"Never raise your prices without letting people know. It shows a position of strength and will give you a nice little influx of cash from the people in the pipeline who were on the fence."
