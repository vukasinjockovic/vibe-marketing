# Four Types of Guarantees

Type: Framework

## Overview

Risk is the #1 objection for any product/service.
A guarantee can 2-4x conversion rates (per Jason Fladlien).
Power formula: "If you do not get [X result] in [Y time], we will [Z]."
Without the "or what" portion, the guarantee is weak and diluted.

## The Four Types

### 1. Unconditional Guarantees
Strongest type. Essentially a trial where they pay first then decide.

**Subtypes:**
- **Full refund** (no questions asked)
- **Partial refund** (e.g., 50%)
- **Refund + ancillary costs** (ad spend, hotel, airfare)
- **Pay for competitor's program**
- **Money back + additional amount** (e.g., refund + $1,000)
- **Satisfaction-based** (refund if they don't feel they got $X of value)

Best for: Lower-ticket B2C (many people won't bother taking the time to refund).
Risky for: Higher-ticket services with high fulfillment costs.

### 2. Conditional Guarantees
Include terms and conditions. Tie conditions to actions that drive success.

**Subtypes:**
- **Outsized Refund**: Double/triple money back IF they did X, Y, Z
- **Service Guarantee**: Keep working free until X achieved (Hormozi's personal favorite)
- **Modified Service Guarantee**: Extra Y-period of service free (2x duration)
- **Credit-Based Guarantee**: Refund as credit toward other services (best for upsells)
- **Personal Service Guarantee**: Owner works 1-on-1 free until result achieved
- **Hotel + Airfare Perks**: Reimburse product cost + travel (workshops/events)
- **Wage-Payment Guarantee**: Pay their hourly rate if session wasn't valuable
- **Release of Service**: Let them out of contract free
- **Delayed Second Payment**: No second bill until first outcome achieved
- **First Outcome Guarantee**: Pay their costs (ad spend, etc.) until first result

Best for: Higher-ticket B2B. Tie conditions to key success actions.
Ideal: "100% of customers qualify but have achieved their result and don't want the refund."

### 3. Anti-Guarantees
Explicitly state "all sales are final." Must have a strong reason why.

**Two approaches:**
- **Exposure-based**: "We're showing you our proprietary process, funnels, ads. Once seen, it can't be unseen. All sales are final."
- **Screening-based**: "If you need a guarantee to take a jump, you're not the type of person we want to work with."

Best for: High-value secrets/IP, high-ticket with heavy customization.
"Since it is so standard to have some sort of guarantee, not having one is attention-worthy."

### 4. Implied Guarantees (Performance Models)
If you don't perform, they don't pay.

**Structures:**
- Performance: $XXX per sale / per show / per unit
- Revshare: X% of top line revenue
- Profit-Share: X% of profit
- Ratchets: 10% if over X, 20% if over Y, 30% if over Z
- Bonuses/Triggers: I get X when Y occurs

Can pair with minimums: "Greater of $1,000 or 10% of revenue generated."
Hybrid: "$1,000/mo for first 3 months, then switches to 100% performance."

## Stacking Guarantees

Stack Pattern 1: Unconditional 30-day + Conditional 90-day (triple money back)
Stack Pattern 2: Conditional + Conditional with sequential outcomes ($10K by 60 days, $30K by 90 days)

## Guarantee Selection Path

1. Starting out? Begin with Service Guarantee or Performance Partnership
2. Low ticket B2C? Broad unconditional
3. High ticket B2B? Specific conditional
4. High fulfillment cost? Anti-guarantee or conditional with tight conditions
5. Want maximum power? Stack unconditional + conditional

## Naming Your Guarantee

Bad: "30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee"
Good: "In 30 days, if you wouldn't jump into shark infested waters to get our product back, we will return every dollar."
Great: Creative imagery that implies extreme satisfaction.
