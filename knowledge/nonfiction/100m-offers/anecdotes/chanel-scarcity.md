## The Tactic

"Chanel, a brand that has maintained insane margins and pricing for over a century, is a master of scarcity. They send only 1-2 of each piece to each store so every store has a different selection and every item is the last or second to last item in stock."

## The Effect

"This allows them to price far above market and turn buying impulses into purchases."

## Agent Application

Extreme scarcity example at the brand level. When every item is the last one in stock, every purchase decision triggers loss aversion. The customer cannot "come back later" -- the item may be gone forever. This is the "Never available again" type of scarcity operating at scale.
