# Arnold Schwarzenegger Fundraiser Anecdote
Source: Alex Hormozi, "$100M Offers", Chapter 11
Type: Anecdote / Case Study

---

## Setting

May 2019. Arnold Schwarzenegger's home. After School All Stars Fundraiser.
$25,000 per ticket. Invite list of only 100.

## Key Characters

- Alex & Leila Hormozi (attendees, donating $1,000,000)
- George (jewelry/watch businessman, late sixties, eastern bloc origins)
- Ben (CEO of the charity)

## The Lesson

George had advised Ben to raise ticket price from $15,000 to $25,000 while cutting the number of tickets. His principle: "When demand increases, cut supply."

Results:
- Raised an extra $1M before the event even started
- All attendees were more qualified donors
- Most successful night in charity history: ~$5,400,000 from 100 people ($54,000/head)
- Every auction item positioned as one-of-a-kind, never available again
- Arnold threw in bonuses when bidding got high enough (allowing both bidders to donate)

## Why This Matters

"The products remained unchanged, yet within this setting, an item that wouldn't sell at a different venue for $10,000 sold for $100,000."

This demonstrates: scarcity (limited tickets, one-of-a-kind items), urgency (if you miss it, it's gone forever), bonuses (Arnold adding extras during bidding), and social proof (celebrity endorsement, peer pressure) all working together.

## Agent Application

This anecdote is the foundational story for the entire Enhancement section. It proves that the same products, presented differently with psychological levers, can sell for 10x the price.
