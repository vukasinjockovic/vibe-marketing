# Weight Loss Satisfaction Guarantee Story

Type: Anecdote / Case Study

## Setup

When Hormozi sold weight-loss programs at his gym, he used an unconditional satisfaction-based guarantee.

## The Guarantee

"Do you think I'd still be in business if I gave a crazy guarantee like that and wasn't good at what I did? Now I'm not guaranteeing you're going to hit this goal in six weeks, after all, because I can't eat the food for you. But I am guaranteeing that you will get $500 worth of value and service from us to support you. If you don't feel like we gave you that level of service, I'll write you a check the day you tell me we suck."

## The Close

"Best case you get the body of your dreams and we give you all your money towards staying with us to hit your long-term goal. Worst case you tell me I suck, I write you a check, and you get six weeks of free training. Both options are risk free. But, the only thing guaranteed not to help you is walking out of here today."

## Results

"I had two people take me up on it out of 4,000 sales in three and a half years."

Refund rate: 2/4,000 = 0.05%

## Agent Application

This is the strongest real-world proof that bold guarantees work. The closing script is a template for any service business: frame both outcomes (best case / worst case) as wins for the prospect, then note that the ONLY guaranteed losing move is inaction.
