# The $50,000 Day Rate Story
Source: Alex Hormozi, "$100M Offers", Chapter 12
Type: Anecdote / Case Study

---

## Setup

Two people offered Hormozi $50,000 for a day of his time after he spoke at an event. They were scaling an education business stuck at $1M/month; Hormozi was doing $1M/week in a similar business type.

## What Happened

He declined. He was making more than $50,000/day in profit and didn't want the distraction.

## The Lesson

Two components to extreme value:
1. **How rare the sources are** (very few people could solve their specific problem)
2. **The actual value being provided** (unlocking $500K+/month in revenue)

These compound to create "breathtaking profits."

## The Deeper Insight

"There is a special type of '0 fucks given' vibe that's hard to replicate when you truly do not need a person's money (or even want it)."

"The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand."

## Agent Application

This story illustrates how genuine scarcity (a person whose time is genuinely limited and genuinely valuable) creates premium pricing. When writing scarcity into offers, the strongest position is genuine limitation -- not manufactured urgency.
