## Statement

"The easiest scarcity strategy is honesty."

## How It Works

Define a real capacity number for your business and share it publicly.

Examples:
- "We are three-fourths of the way to capacity this week"
- "We are 81% to capacity in our total business"

## Why It Works (Dual Mechanism)

1. **Urgency**: People want to sign up "before they lose the chance"
2. **Social proof**: If you're 81% to capacity, that means many people already chose to work with you

## The Control Point

"Only you get to draw where that line is 'full.'"

You determine the capacity number. You determine what "full" means. This gives you the power to create real, ethical scarcity at any level.

## Advantage Over Manufactured Scarcity

- No credibility risk (it's real)
- No tracking/enforcement complexity
- Gets stronger as you fill up (the closer to capacity, the faster remaining spots disappear)
- Self-reinforcing: social proof increases as capacity fills
