## Statement

"Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain."

## Application in Offer Enhancement

This is the psychological foundation for why scarcity works. Humans are far more motivated to take action to hoard a scarce resource than they are to act on something that could help them.

## How It Manifests

- Limited releases create purchase urgency not because people want the item more, but because they fear losing access to it
- Sold-out announcements amplify this: seeing that the choice has been "made for them" increases desire because there is now no way to get it
- Scarcity implies social proof: if others bought it before it sold out, it must be worth having

## Related Concepts

- Loss aversion (Kahneman & Tversky)
- FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
- Endowment effect (once people feel they "almost" had it, losing it feels like a real loss)
