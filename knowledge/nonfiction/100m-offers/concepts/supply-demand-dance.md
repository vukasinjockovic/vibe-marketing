# The Delicate Dance of Desire (Supply-Demand)

## Statement

Supply and demand are inversely correlated. Managing the tension between satisfying desire (supply) and maintaining desire (demand) is the key to maximizing long-term profit.

## Two Failure Modes

1. **Satisfy zero desire (zero supply)**: No money, prospects feel rejected. Takes longer to reach this failure state than you think.

2. **Satisfy all desire (unlimited supply)**: Kills the golden goose. No pent-up demand for future launches. Each successive promotion sells fewer and fewer until demand is fully exhausted.

## The Optimal State

Keep supply slightly under demand at all times.

## The Fractal (80/20) Nature of Demand

Demand is non-linear/fractal: one-fifth of prospects are willing to pay five times the price (or more).

Example:
- 10 people willing to pay $500
- 2 of those 10 willing to pay $5,000
- Selling to only the 2 at $5,000 = same revenue, lower costs, more profit, AND 8 people with pent-up demand for next time

## Analogy

"If you sleep with your significant other everyday they have less desire than if you haven't slept with them for a week. We want the ravenous prospect, not merely the aroused."
