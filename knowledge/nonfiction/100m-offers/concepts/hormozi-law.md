# Hormozi Law
Source: Alex Hormozi, "$100M Offers", Chapter 11
Type: Concept / Principle

---

## Statement

"The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make."

Metaphor: "The longer the runway, the bigger the plane that can take off."

## Application

- Build demand before satisfying it
- Keep supply under demand
- Leave some desire unsatisfied after each launch
- Each successive launch with pent-up demand can charge more
- Satisfying all demand at once kills the golden goose

## Mechanism

Desire disappears once satisfied. Unsatisfied desire compounds. The longer you build desire without offering the satisfaction, the higher the price the market will bear.
