# The Last-Day Phenomenon

## Statement

"The biggest sales on a week long campaign or launch happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (up to 50-60%). That means that the last 3% of the time allotted creates 50-60% of the sales."

## Implication

Deadlines are not optional. They are the primary driver of action.

"That's completely illogical, but also unmistakably human."

## Application

This data point means:
1. Having a deadline at all is more important than almost any other urgency tactic
2. The fear of losing sales by setting a deadline is unfounded -- most who don't buy at deadline wouldn't have bought anyway
3. People who act under deadline pressure were always going to buy, they just needed the push
4. Designing the "last day" experience (emails, reminders, countdown) is disproportionately valuable

## Key Quote

"You will make more money from the many people who decided to take action than people who actually missed out because in reality, those people were never going to buy (heck, they didn't even buy when they had their feet to the fire, so why would they without?)"
