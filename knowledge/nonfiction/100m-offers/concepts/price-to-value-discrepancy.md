# Price-to-Value Discrepancy

## Statement

The gap between the price of an offer and the perceived value of what's included. The wider this gap, the more irresistible the offer becomes.

## How Bonuses Create It

"We anchor the price we tell them to the core offer. Then with each increasingly valuable bonus, that discrepancy grows wider and wider until it's too big to bear and we snap the rubber band in their mind that is holding their wallet in their pocket."

## Key Rules

1. Increase the value side (add bonuses), never decrease the price side (don't discount)
2. Total bonus value should ECLIPSE the core offer value
3. This subconsciously signals: if the bonuses are this valuable, the core offer must be even more valuable
4. Each bonus should have its own price tag, ascribed and justified

## The Infomercial Model

"They would sell one knife for $38.95 then include 37 other knives, sharpeners, pans, and guarantees to beat the prospect into submission. They establish the price, then they expand upon it until you feel it's such a good deal it would be stupid to pass it up."
