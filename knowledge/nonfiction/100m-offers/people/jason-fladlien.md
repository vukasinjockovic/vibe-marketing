### Unconditional Guarantee Script (Verbatim, Chapter 15)
Hormozi includes Fladlien's full unconditional guarantee pitch from a webinar, noting "These are 100% his words and not my own."

Key lines:
- "I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision"
- "You can't make this decision right now for the same reason you don't buy a house without first looking at the inside of it"
- "If you ain't happy, I ain't happy"

### Outsized Refund Guarantee Example (Chapter 15)
For a $2,997 ecommerce course:
- Guarantee: "If you buy this course and spend $X on advertising...and don't make money, I will buy your store from you for $25,000 no questions asked."
- Result: Additional $3M in sales from this guarantee
- Only 10 refunds of $25,000 given out
- Net: $2.75M in extra sales from the guarantee alone
