## Quote Used

"Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want."

## Context

Hormozi uses this quote to establish the psychological foundation for why scarcity and urgency work: we only want things we do not have. As soon as we have them, our desire disappears. Therefore, to increase demand (desire), we must decrease or delay satisfying desires.

## Relevance

This is the theoretical underpinning for the entire Enhancement section. It explains why selling fewer units at higher prices, leaving demand unsatisfied, and creating scarcity all compound to increase long-term profitability.
