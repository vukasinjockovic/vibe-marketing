# The Slippery Slide
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Slippery Slide, Reading Gravity, Greased Slide

## Summary
The Slippery Slide is Joseph Sugarman's central copywriting metaphor and structural framework. It describes the principle that every element in an advertisement must compel the reader to continue reading the next element, creating unstoppable forward momentum -- like sliding down a playground slide coated in grease. Once the reader starts, they cannot stop until they reach the end (the close/offer).

## Key Findings
1. All graphic elements (headline, subheadline, photo, caption, logo, price, response device, layout) exist for one purpose: to get the reader to read the first sentence.

2. The sole purpose of the first sentence is to get the reader to read the second sentence. The sole purpose of the second sentence is to get the reader to read the third.

3. If a reader reads more than 25% of your ad, there is a great probability they will read the entire thing.

4. The slide is maintained through three mechanisms: (a) short, easy-to-read opening sentences, (b) creating a buying environment that harmonizes with the reader, and (c) seeds of curiosity at paragraph transitions.

## Key Quotes
> "Every element in an advertisement must cause that slippery slide effect. The headline must be so powerful and compelling that you must read the subheadline, and the subheadline must be so powerful that you are compelled to read the first sentence."

> "Picture a steep slide at a playground. Now picture somebody putting baby oil or grease along the entire length of the slide including the side rails."

> "Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slide."

## Open Questions
- How does the slide metaphor translate to video/audio formats where "reading" is replaced by "watching"?
- What is the actual 25% threshold based on? Sugarman cites it as proven but does not name the study.
