**Aliases:** Seven Steps to Writing Great Copy, 7-Step Process

## Summary
Sugarman's operational workflow for producing copy, presented in Chapter 22. It reduces the entire book's teaching into a sequential, repeatable process. The steps move from research (becoming an expert) through drafting (emotional outpouring) to refinement (editing and incubation). The key insight is that the first draft is meant to be terrible -- the real skill is in editing and incubation.

## The 7 Steps
1. **Become an expert** on the product or service
2. **Know your prospect** -- motivations, desires, demographics
3. **Write headline and subheadline** -- short headline, ~16-word subheadline, ultra-short first sentence
4. **Write the copy** -- emotional outpouring, ignore grammar/spelling, dump everything
5. **Edit** -- correct spelling, grammar, punctuation; eliminate unnecessary words; tighten
6. **Incubate** -- stop, do something pleasurable, let subconscious process
7. **Final look** -- return with fresh eyes, polish further

## Key Findings
1. The first draft should be an unedited "emotional outpouring" -- grammar and structure are fixed later.

2. Incubation (Step 6) leverages the subconscious mind -- "the more time between what you've just edited and taking the next step, all the better."

3. Steps 5 and 6 can be repeated: "you could easily repeat steps 5 and 6 and continue to edit until you are happy with your results."
