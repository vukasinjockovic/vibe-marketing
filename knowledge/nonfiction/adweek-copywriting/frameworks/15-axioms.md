**Aliases:** Sugarman's Axioms, 15 Axioms, Copywriting Axioms

## Summary
Fifteen foundational rules distilled from each chapter of the book's first two sections. Each axiom captures a core principle of Sugarman's copywriting philosophy. They progress from the nature of copywriting itself (Axiom 1) through the mechanics of the slippery slide (Axioms 2-8) to advanced selling principles (Axioms 9-15). Listed in Appendix C of the book.

## The 15 Axioms
1. Copywriting is a mental process the successful execution of which reflects the sum total of all your experiences, your specific knowledge and your ability to mentally process that information and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the purpose of selling a product or service.
2. All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to do one thing and one thing only: get you to read the first sentence of the copy.
3. The sole purpose of the first sentence in an advertisement is to get you to read the second sentence.
4. Your ad layout and the first few paragraphs of your ad must create the buying environment most conducive to the sale of your product or service.
5. Get the reader to say yes and harmonize with your accurate and truthful statements while reading your copy.
6. Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slide.
7. When trying to solve problems, don't assume constraints that aren't really there.
8. Keep the copy interesting and the reader interested through the power of curiosity.
9. Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept.
10. The incubation process is the power of your subconscious mind to use all your knowledge and experiences to solve a specific problem, and its efficiency is dictated by time, creative orientation, environment and ego.
11. Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the action you request.
12. Every communication should be a personal one, from the writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used.
13. The ideas presented in your copy should flow in a logical fashion, anticipating your prospect's questions and answering them as if the questions were asked face-to-face.
14. In the editing process, you refine your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words.
15. Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive, unless the preventive is perceived as a cure or the curative aspects of the preventive are emphasized.
