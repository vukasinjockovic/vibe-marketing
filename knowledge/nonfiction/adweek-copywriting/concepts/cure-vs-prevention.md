# Cure vs Prevention
**Type:** concept

**Aliases:** Selling the Cure, Cure Over Prevention, Axiom 15

## Summary
The principle that selling a cure is dramatically easier and more profitable than selling a preventive. People do not believe they will get the disease or problem, so preventives are a tough sell. But once they have the problem, they will pay far more for the cure. The strategic implication: always position products as cures (or emphasize their curative aspects) rather than preventives. A preventive can sometimes be repositioned as a cure by emphasizing what it fixes rather than what it prevents.
