# Concept Selling
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Sell the Concept, Sell the Sizzle, Big Idea, USP

## Summary
The principle that you should never sell a product or service directly -- instead, sell the concept, the "Big Idea," the unique positioning angle. The product is the steak; the concept is the sizzle. Every product has a unique personality and a unique way of being presented, and the copywriter's job is to discover that concept. Examples: a walkie-talkie became "Pocket CB," a smoke detector became "The Nose," a remote car starter became "The Mafia Auto Gadget."

2. The concept often emerges from specific product knowledge -- the Laser Beam Digital Watch concept came from learning about the laser-sealed radioactive capsule.

3. The exception: when a product is so new that the product IS the concept.
