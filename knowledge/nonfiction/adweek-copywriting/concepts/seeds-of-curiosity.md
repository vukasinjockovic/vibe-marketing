**Aliases:** Curiosity Seeds, Forward Pull Sentences

## Summary
Short sentences placed at the end of paragraphs that create forward momentum and prevent the reader from stopping. They function like a TV host saying "Stay tuned" before a commercial break. They work subconsciously to maintain slippery slide momentum even when copy pace naturally slows. They are a tactical implementation of the broader curiosity trigger.

## Examples
- "But there's more."
- "So read on."
- "But I didn't stop there."
- "Let me explain."
- "Now here comes the good part."
- "But wait. There is also a patent on the setting feature."

## Key Findings
1. Seeds of curiosity should be placed at paragraph transitions where momentum could naturally slow.
