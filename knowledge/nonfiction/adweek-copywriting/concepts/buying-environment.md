## Summary
The psychological space created through layout, copy tone, word choice, and graphic elements that predisposes a reader to purchase. Sugarman compares it to a physical retail environment -- just as an art gallery uses spotlights, classical music, and a private room to create a buying mood, print copy creates its own environment entirely through words and design. The environment must match the product: premium products need clean, refined environments; bargain products need busy, price-forward environments.

## Key Findings
1. The buying environment is established in the first few paragraphs and the ad layout simultaneously -- it works in tandem with the slippery slide momentum.

2. In print, you have TOTAL control over the environment, unlike a salesperson who may not control the physical space.

3. The environment is created through word choice, phrasing, and the "level of integrity you convey" -- not just visual design.
