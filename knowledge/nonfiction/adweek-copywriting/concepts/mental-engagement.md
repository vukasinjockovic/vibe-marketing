**Aliases:** Whole-Brain Appeal, Letting the Reader Conclude

## Summary
The principle that copy should not state everything explicitly -- the reader's mind must work to reach conclusions, and the effort of reaching those conclusions creates a more positive, enjoyable, and persuasive experience. Sugarman calls this "whole-brain appeal" -- engaging thought, intuition, sensation, and emotion simultaneously. If copy is too obvious, it bores or patronizes. If it lets the reader figure things out, it stimulates and persuades.

## Key Findings
1. "The more the mind must work to reach a conclusion that it eventually successfully reaches, the more positive, enjoyable, or stimulating the experience."

2. Example: stating Seiko's wholesale cost ($150) and retail price ($300) without explicitly saying "jewelers make a fortune" lets the reader reach that conclusion independently -- more powerful than stating it.

3. Hemingway's technique of describing beautiful women in general terms, letting readers imagine them, is an application of this principle.
