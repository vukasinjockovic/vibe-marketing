# Incubation
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid

**Aliases:** Subconscious Processing, Creative Incubation

## Summary
The process of stepping away from a creative problem after intensive study and letting the subconscious mind process millions of permutations. Sugarman considers it essential to the copywriting process (Step 6 of his 7-Step Process). The subconscious works best under some pressure (deadlines, ego) and when you do something pleasurable during the break. Interrupting the incubation process with conscious thinking produces inferior results.

## Key Findings
1. The incubation process uses "all your knowledge and experiences to solve a specific problem" -- its efficiency is dictated by time, creative orientation, environment, and ego.

2. Deadlines and ego pressure actually enhance incubation -- the subconscious needs motivation.

3. The more time between editing and the final look, the better the results.
