**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid

**Aliases:** Mental Bridge, Relating Known to Unknown

## Summary
The technique of connecting what the consumer already knows and understands to what you are selling, creating a mental bridge that makes the new product instantly comprehensible. Examples: "The Nose" for a smoke detector (linking to the human nose's function), "Pocket CB" for a walkie-talkie (linking to the CB radio fad), "Mafia Auto Gadget" for a remote car starter (linking to Mafia car bomb paranoia). Linking reduces cognitive effort for the prospect and makes unfamiliar products feel familiar.

## Key Findings
1. Linking works on its most basic level through fads -- tying a product to something already in the public's consciousness.

2. Even commodity features can be "linked" to perceived quality -- gold contact points in integrated circuits linked to the expense and quality of gold.

3. Linking is especially critical for "miracle products" that are too good to believe -- "vitamins for your car" and "tuneup in a pill."

## Key Quotes
> "Whenever I sell a new product or a unique feature of a new concept, I use linking. I take what is familiar to the prospect, relate it to the object I am selling, and create a bridge in the mind of my prospect."
