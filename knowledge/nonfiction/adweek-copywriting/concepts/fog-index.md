**Aliases:** Gunning Fog Index, Readability Formula, Grade Level

## Summary
A readability formula created by Robert Gunning that measures the grade level needed to understand a piece of writing. Sugarman uses it to calibrate copy complexity to the target audience. The formula combines average sentence length and percentage of multisyllabic words, multiplied by 0.4, to produce a grade level. Sugarman targets grade 5-8 for mass market openings, and notes that best-selling books run at grades 8-10.

## The Formula
1. Take a 100-125 word sample
2. Count words per sentence
3. Divide total words by sentences = average sentence length
4. Count 3+ syllable words (excluding combinations, proper names, -ed/-es verbs)
5. Divide long words by total words = percentage of long words
6. Add average sentence length + percentage of long words
7. Multiply by 0.4 = grade level

## Key Findings
