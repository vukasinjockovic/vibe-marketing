# Satisfaction Conviction
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Satisfaction Guarantee, Beyond-Trial-Period Guarantee

## Summary
A guarantee or offer structure that goes dramatically beyond a standard trial period, making the reader think "They must really believe in their product" or "Are they going to get ripped off?" It is NOT merely a trial period -- it is something so generous it raises eyebrows. Sugarman tested this directly: changing only the satisfaction conviction in a Consumers Hero ad doubled the response rate, even though it appeared at the very end of the ad.

## Key Findings
1. A/B testing showed that changing the satisfaction conviction alone doubled response, even though it was at the very end of the ad.

2. The ideal satisfaction conviction raises an objection and resolves it by going beyond what people expect.

3. Must make sense for the specific offer -- using the wrong resolution for the objection backfires.

## Key Quotes
> "In the test, the response doubled even though the satisfaction conviction was at the very end of the ad."

> "If your potential customer, after reading what you are going to do, says something like, 'They must really believe in their product,' or 'How can they do it?' or 'Are they going to get ripped off by customers who will take advantage of their generosity?' then you know you've got a great example of a satisfaction conviction."
