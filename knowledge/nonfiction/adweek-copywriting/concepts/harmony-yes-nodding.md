**Aliases:** Harmonizing, Resonating, Yes-Nodding, Getting Agreement

## Summary
The principle that copy must make truthful, obvious, agreeable statements that cause the reader to mentally nod "yes" in agreement. This creates psychological harmony between writer and reader, building trust and maintaining momentum. The moment a reader mentally says "No" or "I don't believe that," the slide is broken and the reader is lost. Sugarman compares it to a car salesman building agreement through a series of obvious truths before asking for the sale.

## Key Findings
1. Every statement in the opening paragraphs should be truthful and something the reader would agree with.

2. A single disagreeable statement can break the entire persuasion chain.

3. The technique mirrors face-to-face sales: "Nice day, Mr. Jones" -> "Yes." Build momentum through obvious truths.
