## On the Purpose of Copy Elements
> "All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to do one thing and one thing only: get you to read the first sentence of the copy."

> "The sole purpose of the first sentence in an advertisement is to get you to read the second sentence."

## On the Slippery Slide
> "Every element in an advertisement must cause that slippery slide effect. The headline must be so powerful and compelling that you must read the subheadline, and the subheadline must be so powerful that you are compelled to read the first sentence."

> "Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slide."

## On Honesty and Credibility
> "Try to lie in your copy and you are only deceiving yourself. Your copy will say what you think you wanted it to say, but it will also say what you thought you covered up. Even a reader who hurries over your copy can feel the difference."

> "And it seemed that the more truthful and frank my ads were, the more the consumers responded."

## On Emotion and Logic
> "You sell on emotion, but you justify a purchase with logic."

> "Every word has an emotion associated with it and tells a story."

> "Every good ad is an emotional outpouring of words, feelings and impressions."

## On Selling Concepts
> "Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept."

## On the Buying Environment
> "You wouldn't expect to buy an expensive painting from an Army surplus store and you wouldn't expect to find much of a bargain at Tiffany's."

## On Harmony
> "The moment you get the reader to say 'No' or even 'I really don't believe what he is saying' or 'I don't think that relates to me,' you've lost the reader."

## On Mental Engagement
> "The more the mind must work to reach a conclusion that it eventually successfully reaches, the more positive, enjoyable, or stimulating the experience."

## On Objections
> "If you feel that your prospect might raise some objection when you are describing a product, then raise the objection yourself."

> "If you don't give all the facts, it gives your customer the excuse not to order."

## On Copy Length
> "Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the action you request."

## On Simple vs Complex
> "You should sell a simple product that is clearly understood by the consumer in a more complicated way and a more complicated product in a very simple way."

## On Cure vs Prevention
> "Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive, unless the preventive is perceived as a cure or the curative aspects of the preventive are emphasized."

## On Specificity
> "Ninety-two percent of new dentists use and recommend CapSnap Toothpaste" vs. "New dentists everywhere use and recommend CapSnap Toothpaste."

## On Personal Communication
> "Every communication should be a personal one, from the writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used."

## On Editing
> "In the editing process, you refine your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words."

## On the Writing Life
> "The preparation for becoming a great copywriter is a lifestyle. It's a hunger for knowledge, a curiosity and a desire to participate in life that is broad-based and passionate."

> "Edwin Land, the inventor of the Polaroid camera, said it best when he described his definition of a mistake: 'A mistake is a future benefit, the full value of which is yet to be realized.'"

## On the First Draft
> "Don't worry about sentence structure, grammar, punctuation -- just start writing and keep writing."

> "The first draft of an ad is often terrible and the real skill in copywriting is taking that rough draft and polishing it."

## On Satisfaction Conviction
> "In the test, the response doubled even though the satisfaction conviction was at the very end of the ad."

## On Cliches
> "It's the product the world has been waiting for" -- Sugarman's own early cliche, which he later learned to avoid.

## On Incubation
> "The incubation process is the power of your subconscious mind to use all your knowledge and experiences to solve a specific problem."

## On Familiarity and Words
> "Sometimes, changing just one word in a thousand-word ad will double response."
