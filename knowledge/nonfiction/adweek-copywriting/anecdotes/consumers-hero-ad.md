# Consumers Hero "HOT" Ad
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Consumers Hero Ad, HOT Ad, Stolen Merchandise Ad

## Summary
An ad for Sugarman's discount refurbished products club. The headline "HOT" and subheadline about "stolen merchandise" created irresistible curiosity. The ad harmonized with inflation-frustrated consumers ("Consumers are being robbed. Inflation is stealing our purchasing power"). Most importantly, this ad provided the A/B test data proving the power of satisfaction conviction: changing only the satisfaction conviction from a standard trial period ("refund the unused portion") to something extraordinary ("refund your five dollars plus send you interest on your money") doubled the response rate.

## What It Illustrates
- **Satisfaction conviction A/B test**: The only controlled test data in the book showing a single element doubling response
- **Curiosity through provocative headline**: "HOT" + "stolen merchandise" was irresistible
- **Harmony with consumer frustration**: Using the language of inflation and robbery to resonate with prospects
- **Buying environment for bargains**: Busy, provocative, price-forward environment matched the discount positioning
