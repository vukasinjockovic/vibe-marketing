**Aliases:** Royal Ruby Red Ad, Frank Schultz Ad, Fluke of Nature

## Summary
Frank Schultz, a Texas grapefruit farmer, attended Sugarman's first seminar in 1977 and wrote his first print ad immediately afterward at a local Holiday Inn. The ad for Royal Ruby Red grapefruit became a long-running classic that built his business to 80,000 customers, 14,000 acres, and hundreds of employees. Despite his company's size, customers visualized Frank out in the grove with his picking ring. The ad demonstrates every key principle: storytelling (fairy-tale discovery narrative), technical explanation (for a grapefruit!), rarity/exclusivity ("Not one man in a thousand has ever tasted this grapefruit"), personal communication, simple-product/complex-explanation rule, and a risk-free sample offer as satisfaction conviction.

## What It Illustrates
- **Simple/complex rule**: Simple product (grapefruit) given complex, detailed treatment
- **Personal communication**: "I'm a farmer" -- instant credibility through word associations
- **Rarity for a commodity**: Making grapefruit exclusive through rigorous selection standards
- **Technical explanation for non-technical product**: Sugar content, acid balance, picking rings, sheep nose
- **Storytelling**: Fairy-tale origin (Dr. Webb's grove, one branch, nature's miracle)
- **First-time copywriter success**: Wrote it right after the seminar with minimal editing needed

## Key Quotes
> "I'm a farmer. And the story I tell you is the absolute truth, as incredible as it may seem."
