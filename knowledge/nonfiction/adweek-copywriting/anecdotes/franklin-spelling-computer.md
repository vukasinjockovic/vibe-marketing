# Franklin Spelling Computer Ad
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Misspelled Words Involvement Device

## Summary
Sugarman created an ad for the Franklin Spelling Computer that deliberately misspelled words throughout the copy. Readers were challenged to find all the misspellings. Most readers averaged finding only half. This involvement device -- making readers actively participate by searching for errors -- generated higher average revenue per order than a standard ad approach. It demonstrates Trigger 1 (Feeling of Involvement or Ownership) and Trigger 27 (Mental Engagement) in action.

## What It Illustrates
- **Involvement device**: Making readers physically interact with the ad (searching for misspellings)
- **Mental engagement**: The reader's mind works harder, creating a more stimulating experience
- **Product-appropriate technique**: A spelling computer ad with misspelled words is perfectly matched
