# Vision Breakthrough (BluBlocker Launch Ad)
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid

**Aliases:** BluBlocker Ad, Vision Breakthrough Ad

## Summary
The print ad that launched the BluBlocker sunglasses brand in 1986. Written as a first-person story about Sugarman's friend Len calling him about an incredible pair of sunglasses, the ad used storytelling, curiosity, and technical explanation to sell a product that eventually moved 20 million pairs. The ad's opening tested at a Fog Index of grade 4.9 -- one of JS&A's lowest and most accessible. It deliberately withheld the visual experience of looking through the glasses, forcing prospects to buy to satisfy their curiosity.

## What It Illustrates
- **Storytelling as selling**: The entire ad is a narrative -- Len calls, Sugarman tries the glasses, learns the science, and presents the offer
- **Curiosity as primary motivator**: You cannot experience the glasses without buying them; the TV version also refused to show the view through the lens
- **Technical explanation for credibility**: Blue light focusing in front of the retina is explained simply but specifically
- **Low Fog Index = broad appeal**: Grade 4.9 opening made it accessible to the widest audience
- **Concept selling**: Positioned as "vision breakthrough," not "sunglasses"
