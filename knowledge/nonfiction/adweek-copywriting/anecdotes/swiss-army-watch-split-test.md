# Swiss Army Watch A/B Split Test
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** One Model vs Nine Models Test, Simplicity Test

## Summary
Sugarman tested two versions of a Swiss Army watch ad in the Wall Street Journal using an A/B split. Version A offered nine models (men's, women's, children's in three colors each). Version B offered just one men's black watch. The ads had nearly identical copy and graphics. The single-model ad outpulled the nine-model ad by a 3:1 ratio. This became Sugarman's definitive proof that simplicity in offers is critical -- giving the consumer a confusing array of choices causes them to back off and not buy.

## What It Illustrates
- **Simplicity of offer**: One product, one price, one action dramatically outperforms multiple choices
- **Controlled A/B testing**: Same copy, same publication, same day, different offers
- **Choice paralysis**: Confusion = no purchase
- **Sequencing strategy**: Sell one model first to identify buyers, then offer the full line in a catalog
