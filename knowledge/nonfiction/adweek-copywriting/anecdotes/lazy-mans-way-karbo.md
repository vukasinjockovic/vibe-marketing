# The Lazy Man's Way to Riches (Karbo Ad)
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Karbo Ad, Lazy Man's Way

## Summary
Joe Karbo's classic mail order ad for his self-published book, written in one draft with practically no editing. It ran for years and sold 3 million books. Sugarman uses it as the primary Section Three example, analyzing it paragraph by paragraph. The ad demonstrated nearly every principle in the book: slippery slide through short sentences, disarming honesty ("I'm going to ask you to send me 10 dollars for something that'll cost me no more than 50 cents"), broad market appeal through diverse testimonials, and a novel satisfaction conviction (uncashed check for 31 days).

## What It Illustrates
- **Perfect slippery slide**: Ultra-short sentences, building curiosity throughout
- **Disarming honesty**: Admitting the 50-cent cost of the product builds trust
- **Broad market identification**: Each testimonial addresses a different objection (education, capital, luck, talent, youth, experience)
- **Novel satisfaction conviction**: Not cashing the check for 31 days was unprecedented
- **Personal communication**: First-person, conversational, modest lifestyle descriptions that readers could relate to
- **Incubation in action**: Written in one draft, flowing from Karbo's fully incubated ideas
