## Summary
While walking in Waikiki, Sugarman saw a painting of outer space scenes and entered an elegant gallery. A saleswoman lifted the painting off the wall and led him to a back room -- carpeted floor to ceiling, three easy chairs facing the wall. She mounted the painting, turned up classical music through loudspeakers, and dimmed the lights to two spotlights on the painting. Sugarman was ready to pull out his credit card for the $2,000 painting. This story became Sugarman's primary illustration of the buying environment concept -- how controlling the physical/psychological space predisposes people to buy.

## What It Illustrates
- **Buying environment creation**: The gallery controlled every sensory element to maximize buying mood
- **Progressive engagement**: First attracted to the gallery, then led to the back room, then the full presentation
- **Parallel to print copy**: Just as the gallery controlled the physical space, copy controls the psychological space
