# Magic Baloney (Thermostat Ad)
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Magic Stat Ad, Magic Baloney Ad

## Summary
A JS&A ad for the Magic Stat thermostat that ran for over three years starting in 1983. The ad's unique approach was to open by tearing the product apart -- hating its name ("Yuck"), its plastic case ("How cheap looking"), and its lack of digital readout. This reverse psychology created irresistible curiosity, pulling readers down the slippery slide to discover why Sugarman eventually loved it. A scientist wrote in to complain she had "wasted five minutes of my valuable time reading the entire thing" despite having no interest in thermostats -- Sugarman's most complimentary complaint letter.

## What It Illustrates
- **Slippery slide through contrarian opening**: Starting with hatred of the product created unstoppable curiosity
- **Raising and resolving objections**: Every flaw (name, case, no digital readout) was raised up front and resolved
- **Installation as key objection**: The biggest barrier (installation difficulty) was addressed first as the "one good feature"
- **Humor that sells**: Light, sarcastic tone maintained throughout without undermining the product
- **The scientist complaint letter**: Proof that the slide works even on uninterested, skeptical readers

## Key Quotes
> "You're probably expecting our typical sales pitch, but get ready for a shock. For instead of trying to tell you what a great product the Magic Stat thermostat is, we're going to tear it apart. Unmercifully."

> "Beauty is only skin deep and a name doesn't really mean that much. But we sure wish those guys at Magic Stat would have named their unit something more impressive. Maybe something like Twinkle Temp."
