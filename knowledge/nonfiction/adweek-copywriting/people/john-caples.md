## Summary
Legendary advertising copywriter referenced by Sugarman for two key contributions: (1) demonstrating that changing a single word can alter response by 20% or more (the "fix" vs "repair" example), and (2) authoring books on effective use of words that draw response. Sugarman recommends Caples's books alongside Ogilvy's in Appendix D for learning powerful word selection.

## Key Findings
1. Demonstrated that changing one word ("fix" to "repair" or vice versa) could change ad response by 20%+.
