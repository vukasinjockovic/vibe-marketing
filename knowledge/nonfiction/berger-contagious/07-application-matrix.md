# STEPPS Application Matrix

## Source
- **Book:** Contagious: Why Things Catch On
- **Author:** Jonah Berger
- **Derived from:** Epilogue + Reader's Guide + all six STEPPS chapters

## Purpose

This file turns the STEPPS framework into a practical scoring and diagnostic tool. Use it to:
1. Score existing content before publishing
2. Generate content ideas with virality engineering built in
3. Audit past content to understand what worked and why
4. Brief content creators with specific STEPPS targets

## The STEPPS Diagnostic Questions

Berger provides specific diagnostic questions in his epilogue. These are the exact questions to ask about any piece of content:

### S - Social Currency
1. Does sharing this make the sharer look smart, funny, or in-the-know?
2. Is there something surprising or remarkable that defies expectations?
3. Can we use game mechanics (status, achievement, competition)?
4. Does it make people feel like insiders or part of an exclusive group?
5. Would someone brag about this at a dinner party?

### T - Triggers
1. What environmental cues in the audience's daily life will remind them of this?
2. Is the trigger frequent (daily is ideal, weekly is acceptable, monthly is weak)?
3. Is the link between trigger and product strong and unique (not shared with competitors)?
4. Is the trigger close in time to the desired behavior (purchase, share, visit)?
5. Can we grow the habitat by creating new trigger associations?

### E - Emotion
1. What emotion does this content evoke?
2. Is it HIGH arousal (awe, excitement, humor, anger, anxiety) or LOW arousal (sadness, contentment)?
3. If low arousal, can we reframe? (Sadness -> anger/injustice; contentment -> awe/wonder)
4. Have we gone beyond features to feelings? (Three Whys: Why does this matter? x3)
5. Does it make the audience want to DO something (high arousal) or sit quietly (low arousal)?

### P - Public
1. Is the behavior/product visible to others during use?
2. Does using or sharing this leave behavioral residue (stickers, badges, visible artifacts)?
3. Are we making a private behavior/preference public?
4. Is there a distinctive visual element others can recognize?
5. Could observability backfire? (Are we accidentally normalizing an undesirable behavior?)

### P - Practical Value
1. Does this save people money, time, or effort?
2. Is the deal/value framed for maximum impact? (Rule of 100, reference pricing)
3. Does it exceed expectations? (An expected 10% off is not shareable; an unexpected 50% off is)
4. Is it packaged for easy sharing? (Lists, tips, clear takeaways)
5. Is it narrow enough to trigger "I know exactly who needs this"?

### S - Stories
1. Is there a narrative arc? (Setup -> tension -> resolution)
2. Is the brand INTEGRAL to the story? (Test: Can someone retell it without mentioning us? If yes, redesign.)
3. Is the story retellable in 30 seconds or less?
4. Does the story carry at least one other STEPPS principle inside it?
5. Would someone tell this story unprompted at dinner?

## STEPPS x Content Type Matrix

Rate each cell: 3 = Primary driver, 2 = Strong secondary, 1 = Present but minor, 0 = Not applicable, (-1) = Risk of backfire

## STEPPS Scoring Template

Use this template to score any piece of content before publishing. Score each principle 0-5.

```
CONTENT: [title/description]
TYPE: [social post / blog / email / video / ad / PR / landing page]
TARGET: [who is this for]
DATE: [when will it publish]

SCORING:
  Social Currency:  _/5  Notes: _______________
  Triggers:         _/5  Notes: _______________
  Emotion:          _/5  Notes: _______________
  Public:           _/5  Notes: _______________
  Practical Value:  _/5  Notes: _______________
  Stories:          _/5  Notes: _______________

  TOTAL:            _/30

SCORING GUIDE:
  0 = Not present at all
  1 = Weakly present, not deliberate
  2 = Present but could be stronger
  3 = Solid execution of the principle
  4 = Strong, deliberate engineering
  5 = Exceptional -- this alone could drive virality

BENCHMARKS:
  0-10  = LOW VIRAL POTENTIAL -- rework before publishing
  11-15 = MODERATE -- publishable but won't spread organically
  16-20 = GOOD -- likely to generate organic sharing
  21-25 = STRONG -- high probability of significant spread
  26-30 = EXCEPTIONAL -- engineered for maximum virality

MINIMUM THRESHOLDS:
  - At least 2 principles should score 4+
  - No more than 2 principles should score 0
  - Social posts: Emotion + Social Currency should total 7+
  - Blog/email: Practical Value + Stories should total 7+
  - Video: Emotion + Public should total 7+
  - Ads: Triggers + Practical Value should total 7+
```

## Red Flags Checklist

Before publishing, check for these STEPPS anti-patterns:

| Red Flag | Problem | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| "Interesting but forgettable" | High Social Currency, zero Triggers | Add a daily/weekly environmental trigger |
| "Useful but boring" | High Practical Value, zero Emotion | Apply Three Whys to find emotional core |
| "Viral but brand-less" | High shareability, brand is incidental to story | Redesign so brand is integral (Valuable Virality test) |
| "Emotional but no legs" | High Emotion, zero Triggers | Link emotional content to recurring cue |
| "Exclusive but invisible" | High Social Currency via exclusivity, zero Public | Add visible behavioral residue (badges, stickers) |
| "Sad/depressing" | Low-arousal negative emotion | Reframe sadness as anger (injustice) or awe (overcome adversity) |
| "Too broad" | Content for everyone = content for no one | Narrow the audience to trigger "I know who needs this" |
| "Normalizing the bad" | Making undesirable behavior seem common | Flip to highlight desirable behavior's prevalence |
| "Feature dump" | List of product features, zero emotional resonance | Three Whys: features → benefits → feelings |
| "Story without the brand" | Great narrative, brand can be removed | Restructure so brand is causal, not decorative |

## Quick-Reference Decision Matrix

"I want my content to be..."

| Goal | Primary STEPPS | Secondary STEPPS | Best Format |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Shared immediately and widely | Social Currency + Emotion | Stories | Video, social posts |
| Talked about over weeks/months | Triggers + Social Currency | Public | Recurring content series |
| Forwarded to specific people | Practical Value + Stories | Social Currency | Email, blog, how-to video |
| Imitated by competitors/peers | Public + Social Currency | Triggers | Product design, campaigns |
| Remembered long-term | Stories + Triggers | Emotion | Brand narratives, case studies |
| Drive purchases | Practical Value + Triggers | Emotion | Ads, landing pages, email |
| Build community | Social Currency + Public | Stories | Challenges, badges, events |
| Generate press coverage | Social Currency + Emotion | Stories | PR, stunts, data releases |

## Worked Example: Applying STEPPS

### Product: Premium Photo Canvas (Wedding Photos)

**Content idea:** "What $200 photo canvas customers wish they'd known before ordering"

**STEPPS Score:**

```
CONTENT: "What $200 photo canvas customers wish they'd known before ordering"
TYPE: Social post (Facebook) + Blog
TARGET: Recently engaged / newlywed women, 25-40

SCORING:
  Social Currency:  3/5  Sharing this makes you look like a savvy buyer
  Triggers:         3/5  Wedding season, "photo on the wall" daily trigger
  Emotion:          4/5  Wedding memories = awe + nostalgia (high arousal)
  Public:           4/5  Canvas on the wall IS behavioral residue -- visible to every visitor
  Practical Value:  4/5  Specific tips about sizing, resolution, framing -- actionable
  Stories:          3/5  Customer stories of what they'd do differently

  TOTAL:            21/30 = STRONG
```

**Improvement opportunities:**
- Increase Social Currency by adding insider knowledge ("The trick photographers use...")
- Increase Stories by leading with one specific customer's emotional before/after
- Add Trigger: link to "walking past your living room wall every day" as a daily cue

## Content Creation Workflow Using STEPPS

1. **Start with the goal** -- what do you want this content to achieve? (Awareness, sales, community)
2. **Select primary STEPPS** -- use the Quick-Reference Decision Matrix above
3. **Apply diagnostic questions** -- answer the 5 questions for each selected principle
4. **Draft the content** -- with STEPPS deliberately engineered in
5. **Score it** -- use the Scoring Template
6. **Check red flags** -- run through the Red Flags Checklist
7. **Iterate** -- if score is below 16, rework the weakest principles
8. **Publish and measure** -- track shares, saves, forwards, mentions
