## Core Concept

People share things that make them look good to others. Just as the car we drive and the clothes we wear serve as signals of identity and status, what we talk about influences how others perceive us. Sharing remarkable, exclusive, or game-like experiences makes the sharer seem more interesting, more in-the-know, and higher status.

> "People don't just care about how they are doing, they care about their performance in relation to others."

Social Currency operates through three sub-mechanisms:

1. **Inner Remarkability** - Find what is surprising, novel, or interesting about something
2. **Game Mechanics** - Leverage status systems, milestones, and achievement
3. **Scarcity and Exclusivity** - Make people feel like insiders

## Key Principles

### 1. Inner Remarkability

Things that are surprising, novel, or defy expectations are inherently remarkable -- they are literally "worthy of remark." The key is finding what makes something interesting, even in mundane categories.

**How to find inner remarkability:**
- Break a pattern people take for granted
- Defy expectations about what a product/category can be
- Surface surprising facts or statistics
- Think about what makes something different from what people expect

**Critical insight:** Remarkability exists in every product or idea. You just have to find it. Even Blendtec (a blender company) found remarkability by asking "Will it blend?" with unexpected objects.

### 2. Game Mechanics

People are motivated by achievement, status, and competition. Game mechanics use elements of games -- points, levels, leaderboards -- to make activities feel more engaging and shareable.

**How game mechanics drive sharing:**
- People naturally brag about achievements ("I just hit Gold status!")
- Visible status markers invite questions and social comparison
- Scarcity of higher levels makes achievement more valuable
- Progress tracking creates a desire to continue and share milestones

**Key insight:** "People don't just enjoy getting frequent-flier miles -- they like the program itself. It's intrinsically fun and interesting." The game IS the product experience.

### 3. Scarcity and Exclusivity

Making something scarce or exclusive makes people feel special for having access. This insider feeling drives sharing because telling others about it signals that the sharer is in-the-know.

**Two forms:**
- **Scarcity** - Limiting quantity (limited edition, seasonal availability)
- **Exclusivity** - Limiting access (invitation-only, member-only)

**Paradox:** By making something exclusive, you actually increase word of mouth. People who feel like insiders talk MORE about it, not less.

## Examples from the Book

### Please Don't Tell (Secret Bar)
- Hidden cocktail bar inside Crudo restaurant in NYC's East Village
- No sign, no listed address; enter through a phone booth inside a hot dog restaurant
- Dial "1" on the rotary phone inside the booth, and the back wall opens
- Within weeks of opening, became one of the most sought-after reservations in New York
- No advertising budget whatsoever -- pure word of mouth
- **Why it works:** The secrecy IS the social currency. Telling someone about it makes you the cool person who knows about a hidden gem. People feel like insiders.

### Snapple Facts
- "Real Facts" printed under every Snapple bottle cap
- Facts are surprising and conversation-worthy: "#27: A ball of glass will bounce higher than a ball of rubber"
- Costs Snapple almost nothing to print, but generates enormous word of mouth
- **Why it works:** Inner remarkability. The facts give people something interesting to share. Sharing a Snapple fact makes you seem knowledgeable and fun.

### Blendtec's "Will It Blend?"
- Tom Dickson blended marbles, golf balls, a rake handle, and iPhones
- Videos received 300+ million views
- Sales increased 700% in the first two years
- Budget: $50-100 per video
- **Why it works:** Inner remarkability. A blender destroying an iPhone is shocking and defies expectations. People share because it makes THEM seem interesting for discovering it.

### Frequent-Flier Programs
- American Airlines launched AAdvantage in 1981
- People don't just like earning miles -- they like the STATUS
- Harvard study: "When asked whether they'd rather earn $50K while peers earn $25K, or $100K while peers earn $200K -- the majority chose $50K." People care about relative, not absolute status.
- **Why it works:** Game mechanics. Visible tier status (Silver, Gold, Platinum) creates social comparison and bragging rights.

### Rue La La (Flash Sales)
- Members-only flash sale site; deals available for limited time only
- Scarcity (time-limited) + exclusivity (invitation-only membership)
- Members share deals with friends because recommending an exclusive deal makes them look like savvy insiders
- **Why it works:** Scarcity and exclusivity combined. Being "in" on the deal is itself the social currency.

### McDonald's McRib
- Available only periodically, in select locations
- Generates massive buzz each time it reappears
- "McRib Locator" website created by fans
- **Why it works:** Scarcity. The McRib could be offered year-round, but limiting availability creates urgency and word of mouth each time it returns.

### $100 Cheesesteak (Barclay Prime)
- Kobe beef, lobster tail, truffle butter, Veuve Clicquot champagne
- At a steakhouse, not a cheesesteak place
- Philadelphia went wild sharing this "discovery"
- **Why it works:** Inner remarkability (a $100 cheesesteak defies every expectation about what a cheesesteak is) + Social Currency (sharing it makes you seem like a foodie insider).

## Application Patterns

### Pattern 1: Find Your Inner Remarkability
**When to use:** Any product, content, or idea launch
**How to apply:**
1. Ask: "What is surprising about this?" and "What breaks a pattern?"
2. If nothing is surprising, CREATE the surprise (like Blendtec did with the blender)
3. Frame the remarkable thing as the lead -- don't bury it
4. Test: Would someone at a dinner party mention this? If not, find what they WOULD mention.

### Pattern 2: Build Game Mechanics
**When to use:** Loyalty programs, community engagement, user onboarding
**How to apply:**
1. Create visible status levels or achievement milestones
2. Make progress trackable and shareable
3. Design rewards that are visible to others (badges, titles, icons)
4. Use leaderboards or relative rankings
5. Make higher levels genuinely scarce (not everyone can be Platinum)

### Pattern 3: Create Insider Feeling
**When to use:** Product launches, early access, community building, content releases
**How to apply:**
1. Limit access by invitation, time, or quantity
2. Give early adopters exclusive access they can tell others about
3. Use "secret" framing -- hidden menus, unlisted pages, member-only content
4. Make the exclusivity ITSELF the story (like Please Don't Tell)
5. Don't advertise the exclusive thing broadly -- let insiders spread the word

### Pattern 4: Mint Social Currency for the Sharer
**When to use:** Any content creation
**How to apply:**
1. Ask: "Will sharing this make the SHARER look good?" (not just your brand)
2. Design content that reflects well on whoever passes it along
3. Give people remarkable facts, stats, or stories they can claim as "their" discovery
4. The sharer should look smart, funny, in-the-know, or helpful -- not like they're doing you a favor

## Key Quotes

> "Just as people use money to buy products or services, they use social currency to achieve desired positive impressions among their families, friends, and colleagues."

> "Remarkable things are defined as unusual, extraordinary, or worthy of notice or attention."

> "If something is supposed to be secret, people might well be more likely to talk about it. The notion of secrecy helps fuel the fire."

> "People don't just care about how they are doing, they care about their performance in relation to others."

> "Word of mouth is a prime tool for making a good impression -- as potent as that new car or Prada handbag."
