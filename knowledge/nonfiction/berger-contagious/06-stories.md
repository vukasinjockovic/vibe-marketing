## Core Concept

People don't just share information -- they tell stories. Stories are vessels that carry ideas, morals, brands, and lessons. Like a Trojan Horse, a story carries a hidden payload: the brand, product, or message is embedded inside an engaging narrative, and people pass it along for the story, unwittingly spreading the message inside it.

> "People don't think in terms of information. They think in terms of narratives."

The critical distinction Berger makes is between stories where the brand is **integral** (cannot be retold without mentioning the brand) vs. stories where the brand is **incidental** (can easily be retold without mentioning the brand). Only integral stories generate valuable virality.

## Key Principles

### 1. The Trojan Horse

Stories serve as carriers for information and messages. Just as the Greeks hid soldiers inside a wooden horse to get past Troy's walls, brands must embed their message inside a story that people actually want to tell.

**Why stories work:**
- People naturally think in narrative form, not in lists of facts
- Stories are easier to remember than raw information
- People let their guard down during a story (less counter-arguing than with a direct pitch)
- Stories provide proof by analogy: "If it worked for Jared, it could work for me"

### 2. Valuable Virality Test

Not all viral stories benefit the brand. Berger introduces a critical test:

> "Can you tell the story without mentioning the brand? If yes, the brand is not integral. The story will spread, but the brand won't."

**Integral brand:** The brand is woven so deeply into the story that removing it makes the story collapse. You CANNOT retell a Subway Jared story without mentioning Subway.

**Incidental brand:** The brand is loosely attached to the story. You CAN retell the GoldenPalace.com Olympic streaker story without mentioning the casino. The brand rode the story but wasn't essential to it.

### 3. Stories Are Carriers for All Other STEPPS

Stories amplify every other STEPPS principle:
- A story about discovering a secret bar (Social Currency)
- A narrative that links to a daily routine (Triggers)
- An emotional arc that builds to awe or anger (Emotion)
- A visible transformation others can see (Public)
- A lesson or tip embedded in a narrative (Practical Value)

Stories don't replace the other five principles -- they carry them.

### 4. The Telephone Effect

Allport and Postman's classic "telephone" study: when a story passes through 5-6 people, about 70% of details are lost. BUT the critical, essential details survive.

**Implication for brands:** If your brand information is a peripheral detail, it will be among the 70% that gets dropped. If it is the core of the narrative, it will survive retelling after retelling.

### 5. Build a Story People WANT to Tell

The story must be inherently worth telling -- it must be entertaining, surprising, emotional, or useful on its own merits. People won't tell a story just because a brand wants them to. The story must pass the "dinner party test": would someone bring this up at dinner without being prompted?

## Examples from the Book

### Subway Jared (Brand Integral -- SUCCESS)
- Jared Fogle weighed 425 pounds and lost 245 pounds by eating Subway sandwiches
- He ate a 6-inch turkey sub for lunch and a footlong veggie sub for dinner, plus walks
- A friend wrote about his story in the Indiana University newspaper; it was noticed by Subway's ad agency
- The "Jared campaign" ran for years and became one of the most successful ad campaigns in fast food history
- **Why it works:** You CANNOT tell Jared's story without mentioning Subway. The brand is integral to the narrative. Every retelling = a Subway advertisement. The story also carried Practical Value (a concrete weight-loss method) and Emotion (awe at the transformation).

### Dove "Evolution" Video (Brand Integral -- SUCCESS)
- Time-lapse video showing a normal woman transformed into a supermodel through makeup, lighting, and Photoshop
- Ends with: "No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted"
- 16+ million views; Dove's sales saw double-digit growth
- **Why it works:** The story IS about unrealistic beauty standards, and Dove's brand positioning (real beauty) is the message. You can't retell the video's point without at least mentioning the concept Dove stands for. The brand is woven into the moral of the story.

### Panda Cheese Ads (Brand Integral -- SUCCESS)
- Egyptian cheese brand created a series of commercials where a giant panda appears whenever someone refuses Panda Cheese
- The panda silently destroys their office, grocery cart, or kitchen
- Wildly shareable, millions of views
- **Why it works:** The panda's destruction ONLY makes sense in context of refusing Panda Cheese. You cannot retell these stories without mentioning the brand. The brand name IS the character.

### GoldenPalace.com Olympic Streaker (Brand NOT Integral -- FAILURE)
- GoldenPalace.com paid a man to streak at the 2004 Olympics wearing only the casino's URL on his chest
- The stunt made global news; everyone talked about the streaker
- Almost nobody remembered or mentioned GoldenPalace.com
- **Why it works (in reverse):** The streaking story is complete without the brand. "A guy streaked at the Olympics" is the story; the casino URL is an incidental detail that gets dropped in retelling. Millions of impressions, near-zero brand recall.

### Trojan Horse Origin Story
- Greeks built a giant wooden horse and hid soldiers inside
- Trojans brought it inside their city walls as a trophy
- Greek soldiers emerged at night and opened the gates
- The story has been retold for 3,000 years
- **Why Berger uses it:** It's the perfect metaphor for branded storytelling. The "soldiers" (brand message) are hidden inside the "horse" (entertaining story). People pass along the horse because it's a great story; the soldiers come along for free.

### Ron Bensimhon's Belly Flop (GoldenPalace.com Again)
- GoldenPalace.com paid Ron Bensimhon to belly-flop into the diving pool at the 2004 Athens Olympics wearing a GoldenPalace.com tutu
- He was tackled by security; it made international news
- Again: the stunt story is retold without the brand name
- **Why it fails:** Same pattern. The brand is easily separable from the narrative. People tell "the belly flop story," not "the GoldenPalace.com story."

### Denise Grady's Medical Articles (NYT)
- Grady's articles about medical topics made the Most Emailed list frequently
- She told stories of patients and procedures, embedding medical facts inside human narratives
- The same information as a dry factual report would not have been shared
- **Why it works:** Narrative framing. The medical facts are the "soldiers"; the patient stories are the "Trojan Horse." People share the story, and the useful medical information travels with it.

## Application Patterns

### Pattern 1: Apply the Valuable Virality Test
**When to use:** Before launching any branded content, campaign, or viral attempt
**How to apply:**
1. Write out the story you want people to tell
2. Try to retell it without mentioning your brand
3. If the story works fine without the brand: REDESIGN. The brand must be essential.
4. If the story collapses without the brand: you have valuable virality
5. Test with someone who doesn't know your brand. Have them retell it. Does your brand survive?

### Pattern 2: Make the Brand the Plot, Not the Setting
**When to use:** Branded content, video ads, social campaigns
**How to apply:**
1. The brand should be the CAUSE of the story's key event (Jared's weight loss was CAUSED by Subway)
2. Not just the backdrop or sponsor (GoldenPalace.com was just the backdrop of the streaker)
3. Ask: "What role does my brand play in this story? Is it the protagonist, the tool, the cause -- or just the sponsor?"
4. If sponsor, restructure so the brand is causal
5. The brand's involvement should explain WHY the remarkable thing happened

### Pattern 3: Embed Other STEPPS Inside Stories
**When to use:** When layering multiple STEPPS principles
**How to apply:**
1. Write the story first, then check which STEPPS it carries
2. Social Currency: Does the story make the teller look good?
3. Triggers: Is there a daily environmental cue that will remind people of the story?
4. Emotion: Does the story arc hit a high-arousal emotion?
5. Public: Is the story about something visible and imitable?
6. Practical Value: Does the story contain a useful lesson or tip?
7. The best stories carry 3+ STEPPS simultaneously

### Pattern 4: Build Retellable Narratives
**When to use:** Any marketing content intended for word of mouth
**How to apply:**
1. Use a clear narrative arc: setup → tension/surprise → resolution
2. Keep it simple enough to retell in 30 seconds (the "telephone test")
3. Include ONE memorable, specific detail (Jared = 425 lbs to 180 lbs eating subs)
4. The moral or punchline should naturally include your brand
5. Test: Can someone who heard the story secondhand retell it accurately?

### Pattern 5: The Customer Story Formula
**When to use:** Testimonials, case studies, user-generated content
**How to apply:**
1. Find a customer with a dramatic before/after (the bigger the transformation, the better the story)
2. The transformation must be CAUSED by your product (integral, not incidental)
3. Include specific, concrete details (245 pounds lost, not "a lot of weight")
4. Let the customer tell it in their own words (authentic voice)
5. The customer becomes the protagonist; your product is the tool that enabled their transformation

## Key Quotes

> "People don't think in terms of information. They think in terms of narratives."

> "Stories are like Trojan Horses... carry information along for the ride."

> "Is the story you've crafted like a Trojan Horse? ... Make sure the information you want to convey is critical to the narrative."

> "Can people retell the story without the brand? If so, the idea is not really benefiting from the narrative."

> "Build a narrative that is so engaging that people can't help but share it. But make sure the information you want to convey is woven so deeply into the story that people can't retell the story without it."

> "In about five to six transmissions... approximately 70 percent of the details were lost. But the core gist of the story tends to be preserved."
