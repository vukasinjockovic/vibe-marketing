## Core Insight

Virality is not random and not luck. Word of mouth follows a set of underlying principles that make things more likely to be talked about and shared. Berger identifies six key drivers, organized into the acronym **STEPPS**:

1. **Social Currency** - We share things that make us look good
2. **Triggers** - Top of mind means tip of tongue
3. **Emotion** - When we care, we share
4. **Public** - Built to show, built to grow
5. **Practical Value** - News you can use
6. **Stories** - Information travels under the guise of idle chatter

## Why Word of Mouth Matters

- Word of mouth is the primary factor behind 20-50% of all purchasing decisions
- Word of mouth is more persuasive than advertising because it is more targeted (people share with those who are actually interested) and more honest (friends have no ulterior motive)
- Only 7% of word of mouth happens online; the vast majority is offline, face-to-face conversation
- Word of mouth is more effective than traditional advertising: "A five-star review on Amazon leads to approximately twenty more books sold than one additional five-star review on Amazon.com"

## The STEPPS Framework

Berger explicitly states these are not a recipe but more like "tasty salad toppings" -- not every ingredient is required for every piece of content. The key is to understand which principles apply and layer on as many as possible.

### How the Six Principles Interconnect

| Principle | Drives | Best For |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Social Currency | Initial sharing impulse | Launches, exclusives, remarkable facts |
| Triggers | Sustained, repeated sharing | Ongoing campaigns, brand association |
| Emotion | Rapid, passionate sharing | Awareness campaigns, cause marketing |
| Public | Passive visibility and imitation | Product design, social proof |
| Practical Value | Targeted, helpful sharing | Educational content, how-to, deals |
| Stories | Deep engagement and retention | Brand narratives, long-form content |

### Immediate vs. Ongoing Word of Mouth

Berger distinguishes between two types of word of mouth:
- **Immediate word of mouth** - Sharing right after experiencing something (driven by Social Currency, Emotion, Practical Value)
- **Ongoing word of mouth** - Sharing weeks or months later, triggered by environmental cues (driven primarily by Triggers)

Both matter. Products and ideas need to generate not just an initial buzz but sustained conversation over time.

## Key Founding Examples

### Barclay Prime's $100 Cheesesteak
Howard Wein created a $100 cheesesteak at Barclay Prime steakhouse -- Kobe beef, lobster tail, truffle butter, served with a small bottle of Veuve Clicquot. The cheesesteak became the most talked-about item in Philadelphia, generating massive word of mouth. It leveraged Social Currency (remarkable/surprising), Triggers (Philly + cheesesteak = frequent trigger), and Practical Value (people shared the "discovery" with foodie friends).

### Blendtec's "Will It Blend?"
Tom Dickson blended marbles, golf balls, and eventually an iPhone in his $400 blender. Videos got 300+ million views. First two years: sales increased 700%. It worked because the content was inherently remarkable (Social Currency), generated awe/surprise (Emotion), and the brand was integral to the story (Stories -- you cannot retell it without mentioning Blendtec).

## Berger's Core Thesis

> "Contagious content is like gold. Whatever your product or idea, you'll have to figure out how to mine it. You'll have to find the inherent virality."

The principles work for products, ideas, policies, workplace rumors, YouTube videos, and everything in between. They explain why certain stories dominate the water cooler, why some products get buzz, and why certain YouTube videos go viral while others languish.

## Application Notes

- Apply STEPPS as a diagnostic checklist: score existing content against all six principles
- Use STEPPS as a generative framework: when creating content, deliberately engineer at least 2-3 principles
- The principles are domain-agnostic -- they work for B2C, B2B, nonprofits, political campaigns, and personal brands
- Not all six need to be present, but more is generally better
- Some principles naturally pair well: Social Currency + Public (visible exclusivity), Triggers + Emotion (repeated emotional cues), Practical Value + Stories (useful narrative)
