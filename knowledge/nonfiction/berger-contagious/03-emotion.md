## Core Concept

Naturally contagious content evokes emotion. But not just any emotion -- specific emotions drive sharing while others suppress it. The critical variable is **arousal**: high-arousal emotions (whether positive or negative) increase sharing, while low-arousal emotions decrease it.

> "When we care, we share."

Sharing is partly driven by emotional regulation -- people share emotional content to process their feelings, to connect with others, and to relieve physiological tension. The physical activation of arousal (increased heart rate, adrenaline) literally makes people more likely to share.

## Key Principles

### 1. The Arousal Model

Not all emotions are created equal for sharing. Berger's research identified a clean split:

| High Arousal (SHARE) | Low Arousal (DON'T SHARE) |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Awe | Sadness |
| Excitement | Contentment |
| Humor (amusement) | |
| Anger | |
| Anxiety | |

**Critical insight:** Both positive AND negative emotions can drive sharing -- what matters is whether they are high-arousal (activating) or low-arousal (deactivating).

- **Awe** (positive, high arousal) -- SHARES: Susan Boyle, grand vistas, breakthrough science
- **Anger** (negative, high arousal) -- SHARES: injustice stories, bad customer service, political outrage
- **Sadness** (negative, low arousal) -- SUPPRESSES sharing: depressing news, tragedy without resolution
- **Contentment** (positive, low arousal) -- SUPPRESSES sharing: pleasant but not activating

### 2. Awe Is the Most Powerful Sharing Emotion

Berger's analysis of New York Times Most Emailed articles found that awe-inspiring content was 30% more likely to make the Most Emailed list, even controlling for topic, author, placement, and other factors.

Awe is the sense of wonder and amazement that occurs when someone is inspired by great knowledge, beauty, sublimity, or might. It involves:
- Surprise + vastness (physical or mental)
- A sense that existing mental frameworks need to be updated
- A feeling that the world is bigger/more complex than previously thought

### 3. The Three Whys Technique

When creating content, Berger recommends the "Three Whys" technique to find the emotional core:

1. **Why is this important?** Surface-level answer
2. **Why does THAT matter?** Dig deeper
3. **Why does THAT matter?** Reach the emotional root

**Example (Google search):**
- Why does Google matter? It helps you search the internet.
- Why does searching the internet matter? It helps you find information.
- Why does finding information matter? It helps you connect with people and things you care about.

This is how Google's "Parisian Love" Super Bowl ad was born -- not about search technology, but about a love story told through search queries.

### 4. Physiological Arousal Itself Drives Sharing

Berger's jogging study: People who exercised (jogged in place) before being shown content were significantly more likely to share it -- even though the exercise had nothing to do with the content. Physical arousal from ANY source increases sharing behavior.

- After exercise: 75% of participants shared an article
- Control group: much lower sharing rate
- Implication: Context matters. Content consumed during or after activating experiences (exercise, sports, scary movies) is more likely to be shared.

### 5. Emotional Content vs. Emotional Framing

Two approaches:
- **Emotional content:** The topic itself is emotional (a dying child, an injustice)
- **Emotional framing:** A neutral topic is presented in an emotional way (Google's search functionality framed as a love story)

Emotional framing is usually the more useful technique because most products and ideas are not inherently emotional. The Three Whys helps you find the emotional angle.

## Examples from the Book

### Susan Boyle's Britain's Got Talent Audition
- Frumpy middle-aged woman from a small Scottish village walks on stage
- Judges and audience visibly skeptical
- She sings "I Dreamed a Dream" and is extraordinary
- 100+ million views in the first 9 days (before YouTube was mainstream)
- **Why it works:** Pure awe. The gap between expectation (she'll be terrible) and reality (she's brilliant) creates a massive awe response. High arousal positive emotion drives immediate and massive sharing.

### United Breaks Guitars (Dave Carroll)
- United Airlines baggage handlers broke Dave Carroll's $3,500 Taylor guitar
- After 9 months of runaround and denial from United, he wrote a song about it
- "United Breaks Guitars" got 3+ million views in 10 days
- United's stock price fell 10% ($180 million in value) around that time
- **Why it works:** Anger. High-arousal negative emotion. People were outraged on Carroll's behalf. The anger activated sharing. It also leveraged Social Currency (sharing it made you look like a consumer advocate).

### Google's "Parisian Love" Super Bowl Ad
- Tells the story of an American student who falls in love with a French woman, entirely through Google searches
- Searches progress: "study abroad Paris France" → "cafes near the Louvre" → "translate tu es tres belle" → "long distance relationship advice" → "jobs in Paris" → "churches in Paris" → "how to assemble a crib"
- No actors, no voiceover, no special effects -- just a search bar
- Became one of the most shared Super Bowl ads ever
- **Why it works:** Emotional framing. Google search is not emotional. But a love story told through searches creates awe, warmth, and excitement. The Three Whys in action: search → finding information → connecting with people you love.

### Denise Grady's "The Mysterious Cough" (NYT)
- Article about the mechanism by which people cough, illustrated with slow-motion medical imagery
- Made the Most Emailed list for weeks
- Topic: coughing. Not inherently shareable.
- **Why it works:** Awe. The slow-motion imagery of what happens inside the body when you cough was awe-inspiring -- it made people see something mundane in a completely new way.

### Anti-Drug PSAs Using Sadness
- Campaigns showing sad stories of drug addicts were less effective than expected
- Sadness is low-arousal -- it made people feel helpless and withdrawn
- Instead of motivating action, sad anti-drug messages made people tune out
- **Why it works (in reverse):** Low-arousal negative emotion suppresses sharing and action. Compare with the anger-driven "United Breaks Guitars" which activated people.

### Most Emailed NYT Articles Study
- Berger and Milkman analyzed 7,000 NYT articles over 3 months
- Controlled for topic, author, placement, length, and timing
- Found: Awe-inspiring articles were 30% more likely to make the Most Emailed list
- Angry articles were 34% more likely to make the list
- Sad articles were 16% LESS likely to make the list
- Practical/useful articles were 30% more likely (Practical Value)

## Application Patterns

### Pattern 1: Choose High-Arousal Emotions
**When to use:** Any content creation
**How to apply:**
1. Identify the emotional response your content will generate
2. Check the arousal model: Is it high-arousal (awe, excitement, humor, anger, anxiety) or low-arousal (sadness, contentment)?
3. If low-arousal, reframe: Turn sadness into anger (injustice framing), turn contentment into awe (reveal the extraordinary in the ordinary)
4. Test: Does the content make you want to DO something (share, respond, act)? That's high arousal. Does it make you want to sit quietly? That's low arousal.

### Pattern 2: Use the Three Whys
**When to use:** When your product/topic seems unemotional
**How to apply:**
1. State what your product does (functional level)
2. Ask "Why does that matter?" -- go one level deeper
3. Ask "Why does THAT matter?" -- reach the human/emotional level
4. Build your content around that deepest emotional level
5. Example: Accounting software → saves time → spend more time with family → content about work-life balance, not about spreadsheets

### Pattern 3: Awe as a Default Strategy
**When to use:** When you need a safe, positive high-arousal emotion
**How to apply:**
1. Reveal something your audience didn't know was possible
2. Show the extraordinary inside the ordinary (like the coughing article)
3. Use scale, beauty, or human achievement to create wonder
4. Before-and-after transformations create awe (Susan Boyle effect: low expectation → high result)
5. Scientific facts, behind-the-scenes processes, and hidden complexity all generate awe

### Pattern 4: Anger as a Mobilization Tool
**When to use:** Advocacy, cause marketing, competitive positioning, injustice framing
**How to apply:**
1. Frame the situation as an injustice or unfairness
2. Give the audience a clear "villain" (a company, a system, a practice)
3. Make the victim relatable
4. Provide an action the audience can take (share, boycott, sign)
5. WARNING: Anger is powerful but risky. It can backfire if directed at you or if the anger feels manufactured.

### Pattern 5: Engineer the Arousal Context
**When to use:** Content distribution and timing
**How to apply:**
1. Distribute content during or after naturally arousing moments (post-workout, post-event, during commute)
2. Pair content with arousing lead-ins (exciting intro before the CTA)
3. Use physical activation cues in video content (fast cuts, dynamic movement)
4. Social media: Post during moments of natural excitement (Friday evening, game day, event endings)

> "Anger and anxiety lead people to share because, like awe, they are high-arousal emotions. They kindle the fire, activate people, and drive them to take action."

> "Sadness... is a low-arousal emotion. Rather than firing people up, it actually turns the lights out."

> "Any time we can take something and make it emotional, it spreads."

> "Rather than harping on features or facts, we need to focus on feelings."
