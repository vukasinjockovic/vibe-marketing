## Core Concept

People share practically useful information to help others. If Social Currency is about the sharer looking good, Practical Value is about the sharer BEING helpful. "News you can use" is one of the most fundamental drivers of sharing -- people want to help the people they care about.

> "People don't just value practical information, they share it. Offering practical value helps make things contagious."

The chapter draws heavily on behavioral economics (Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory) to explain WHY certain deals, tips, and useful content get shared more than others.

## Key Principles

### 1. Prospect Theory and Reference Points

People evaluate deals and value relative to a reference point, not in absolute terms. What feels like a "good deal" depends entirely on what the person expects.

**Key mechanisms:**
- **Reference point dependence:** A $10 discount on a $35 shirt feels great. A $10 discount on a $500 suit feels meaningless. Same $10.
- **Diminishing sensitivity:** The difference between $10 and $20 feels huge. The difference between $500 and $510 barely registers. People are more sensitive to changes near the reference point.
- **Loss aversion:** Losses feel roughly 2x as painful as equivalent gains feel good. Framing something as avoiding a loss is more powerful than framing it as achieving a gain.

### 2. The Rule of 100

Berger cites the "Rule of 100" for deciding whether to present a discount as a percentage or a dollar amount:

- **Under $100:** Use PERCENTAGE off (20% off a $30 item = $6 off, but "20% off" sounds bigger)
- **Over $100:** Use DOLLAR amount off ($200 off a $1,000 laptop sounds bigger than "20% off")

The principle: whichever number LOOKS bigger is the one to use.

### 3. Deals and the Psychology of "Incredible Value"

Several factors make deals more shareable:

- **Surprise factor:** The deal must EXCEED expectations. A predictable 10% discount is not remarkable. An unexpected 40% discount gets shared.
- **Restriction signals quality:** Quantity limits ("limit 2 per customer") and time limits ("today only") actually INCREASE perceived value and sales. In one study, quantity limits increased sales by 50%.
- **Reference price anchoring:** Showing the original price next to the sale price increases perceived deal quality. "$100 Now $60" is more powerful than just "$60."

### 4. Packaging Information for Sharing

Useful information needs to be packaged in a way that makes it easy to share:

- **Concise format:** Lists, tips, rules of thumb are more shareable than long essays
- **Clear takeaway:** The "so what" must be immediately obvious
- **Actionable:** Reader should know exactly what to DO with the information
- **Credible source:** Expertise or data backing increases sharing (people don't want to share bad advice)

### 5. The Narrow Audience Paradox

Content that seems relevant to a narrow audience actually gets shared MORE broadly than content aimed at everyone.

**Berger's explanation:** When people see content relevant to a specific person in their life, they think "I know someone who needs this!" and share it directly with that person. Broad content doesn't trigger that specific connection.

**Example:** An article about "tax tips for retirees" gets shared MORE than "general tax tips" because people immediately think of a specific retiree they know and forward it to them.

## Examples from the Book

### Ken Craig's Corn on the Cob Video
- Ken Craig, 86 years old, posted a video on how to shuck corn cleanly using a microwave
- The video received 5+ million views
- Ken Craig was not a celebrity, not a chef, not a YouTuber -- just a man sharing a useful trick
- **Why it works:** Pure Practical Value. The tip was genuinely useful (anyone who eats corn can use it), surprising (most people didn't know this method), easy to share ("you have to see this"), and narrow enough to trigger "my mom/grandma needs to see this."

### Vanguard's MoneyWhys Newsletter
- Vanguard (investment company) sends a newsletter with financial tips and advice
- Not about Vanguard's products -- about genuinely useful personal finance information
- Readers forward it to family and friends regularly
- **Why it works:** Useful, credible (from a trusted financial institution), and triggers the narrow audience paradox (people forward specific articles to specific family members who need that advice).

### "$100 Savings" vs. "33% Off"
- Berger cites the study: offering a $200 grill at "33% off" vs. "get 33% more" vs. "$67 off"
- "33% more" increased sales by more than the equivalent percentage or dollar discount
- People respond to whichever framing FEELS like the biggest deal, not what's mathematically equivalent

### The $10 Beer Experiment
- People were asked how much they'd pay for a beer from a fancy resort hotel vs. a run-down grocery store
- Identical beer, identical brand
- People were willing to pay significantly more for the same beer at the resort
- **Why it works:** Reference points. The expected price at a resort is higher, so even a high price feels "fair." At a grocery store, the same price feels like a ripoff. The reference point shifts perceived value.

### Quantity Limits and Sales
- Study: when signs said "Limit 12 per customer" on Campbell's soup, people bought an average of 7 cans
- Without the limit sign: people bought an average of 3.3 cans
- A 50%+ increase in sales from adding a quantity limit
- **Why it works:** The limit signals scarcity (Social Currency), suggests high demand, and creates a reference point (12 = the "normal" amount, so buying 7 feels moderate).

### NY Times Most Emailed Articles
- Berger and Milkman's study: articles with practical information were 30% more likely to make the Most Emailed list
- This held even after controlling for topic, author, placement, and emotional content
- Health, education, and personal finance tips were disproportionately shared

## Application Patterns

### Pattern 1: Lead with Usefulness
**When to use:** Any content marketing, email newsletters, social posts
**How to apply:**
1. Ask: "What problem does this solve for the reader's FRIEND?" (not the reader -- the person they'll share it with)
2. Make the useful information the headline, not the product pitch
3. Format as tips, lists, how-tos, or rules of thumb
4. Include a clear, actionable takeaway in the first 2 sentences
5. Cite a credible source or data point

### Pattern 2: Frame Deals for Maximum Impact
**When to use:** Promotions, discounts, sales, offers
**How to apply:**
1. Apply the Rule of 100: percentage off for items under $100, dollar amount off for items over $100
2. Always show the original price as a reference point ("Was $150, Now $89")
3. Add restrictions that signal value: "Limit 2 per customer," "Today only," "First 100 orders"
4. Frame as loss avoidance when possible: "Don't miss out on $50 savings" vs. "Save $50"
5. Make the deal EXCEED expectations -- predictable discounts don't get shared

### Pattern 3: Exploit the Narrow Audience Paradox
**When to use:** Content targeting and distribution
**How to apply:**
1. Instead of broad content ("tips for everyone"), create narrow content ("tips for new parents in their 30s")
2. The narrower the audience, the more likely someone thinks "I know exactly who needs this" and shares
3. Use demographic, situational, or interest-based narrowing
4. Don't worry about reaching fewer people -- narrow content travels FARTHER through sharing
5. Create multiple narrow-audience pieces instead of one broad piece

### Pattern 4: Package for Shareability
**When to use:** Any informational content
**How to apply:**
1. Use numbered lists or bullet points (easier to scan and share than paragraphs)
2. Give it a clear, descriptive title that signals value ("7 Ways to..." "The Trick to...")
3. Keep it concise -- shareable content is skimmable content
4. Include one surprising fact or counterintuitive insight as the hook
5. Make the action step obvious: "Next time you [situation], try [tip]"

### Pattern 5: Leverage Reference Points
**When to use:** Pricing, product comparisons, value propositions
**How to apply:**
1. Always establish a reference point before revealing the price or value
2. Show what others charge, what the "normal" price is, or what the item was worth before
3. Use anchoring: present the high number first, then the lower number
4. Frame value in terms of familiar comparisons ("Less than a cup of coffee per day")
5. Use competitor pricing as an implicit reference: "Others charge $200/mo. We charge $49/mo."
