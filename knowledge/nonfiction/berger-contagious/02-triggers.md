## Core Concept

Triggers are stimuli in the environment that prompt people to think about related things. If people are frequently triggered to think about a product or idea, they will talk about it more. Social Currency gets people talking initially, but Triggers keep them talking over time.

The key insight is that word of mouth is not just driven by how interesting something is -- it is driven by how often people are reminded of it. Products and ideas that are linked to frequent environmental cues get more word of mouth than more interesting products linked to rare cues.

## Key Principles

### 1. Frequency vs. Strength of Trigger

The ideal trigger is both frequent (happens often in daily life) AND strongly linked to your product. But if you have to choose, frequency wins.

- **Hot cocoa** is linked to winter -- strong link but rare trigger (seasonal)
- **Coffee** is consumed daily -- frequent trigger
- Kit Kat linked itself to coffee breaks, giving it a daily trigger instead of a seasonal one

**Critical distinction:** Interesting products without triggers fade. Boring products with frequent triggers persist.

### 2. Habitat: The Context of Triggers

Where and when people encounter your trigger matters. Berger calls this the "habitat" -- the set of triggers in someone's everyday environment.

- Products with broader habitats get triggered more often
- You can GROW the habitat by creating new trigger associations
- The best triggers are things people encounter daily: morning routines, commutes, meals, seasons, days of the week

### 3. Growing the Habitat

You don't have to accept existing triggers -- you can engineer new ones.

**Kit Kat's strategy:**
- Kit Kat was declining in sales
- Agency Colleen Chorak linked Kit Kat to coffee breaks: "Kit Kat and coffee"
- Radio ads, print, events -- all reinforcing the Kit Kat + coffee link
- Result: Sales increased 33%, from $300 million to $500 million
- Coffee is consumed multiple times daily = very frequent trigger

### 4. Immediate vs. Ongoing Word of Mouth

- **Immediate WOM:** Happens right after an experience (movie just watched, restaurant just visited)
- **Ongoing WOM:** Happens days, weeks, or months later, prompted by triggers

Berger's research found that products with more triggers generated 15% more word of mouth, even controlling for how interesting they were.

### 5. Effective vs. Ineffective Triggers

An effective trigger must be:
- **Frequent** in the target audience's environment
- **Strongly linked** to your product (not too many competing associations)
- **Close in time** to when the desired behavior should happen (a weekday trigger works better for a workday product)

## Examples from the Book

### Kit Kat + Coffee
- Kit Kat was declining when Colleen Chorak took over marketing
- Linked Kit Kat to coffee: "A break's best friend"
- Coffee is consumed billions of times per day worldwide
- Every coffee break became a trigger to think of Kit Kat
- Sales rose from $300 million to $500 million (33% increase)
- **Why it works:** Extremely high-frequency trigger (multiple times daily), strong link (break = Kit Kat), close in time (coffee break = snack moment)

### Rebecca Black's "Friday"
- Widely considered one of the worst songs ever made
- Views on YouTube spiked every Friday and dropped on other days
- The word "Friday" in the title turned every Friday into a trigger
- Generated 300+ million views despite being universally mocked
- **Why it works:** The day of the week is an unavoidable, weekly trigger. Every Friday, people are reminded of the song and share it again.

### Mars Bars and NASA
- When NASA's Pathfinder mission landed on Mars in 1997, Mars candy bar sales went up
- No connection between the candy and the planet -- but the name "Mars" was everywhere in the news
- The planet Mars triggered thoughts of the candy bar Mars
- **Why it works:** Unintentional but powerful trigger. The name association was enough to boost sales.

### French Music and French Wine
- Study by Adrian North: when a store played French music, French wine outsold German wine 5 to 1
- When German music played, German wine outsold French
- Shoppers were unaware of the influence -- only 1 in 7 mentioned the music
- **Why it works:** The music triggered thoughts of France/Germany, which influenced the purchase at the moment of decision.

### Cheerios vs. Disney World
- Berger's study: Cheerios gets more daily word of mouth than Disney World
- Disney World is far more interesting and exciting
- But Cheerios is eaten at breakfast every morning -- it has a daily trigger
- Disney World is visited once every few years -- rare trigger
- **Why it works:** Frequency beats interestingness. A boring daily trigger generates more total word of mouth than an exciting rare one.

### Voting in Schools
- Jonah Berger's study: when polling stations were in schools, support for school funding measures increased by 10,000+ votes
- The physical environment of the school triggered thoughts about education and children
- **Why it works:** Environmental trigger at the exact moment of decision-making. The trigger was proximate to the behavior.

### BuzzFeed "Which City Should You Actually Live In?" Quiz
- The quiz went viral partly because cities are part of everyone's daily environment
- Where you live, where you've visited, where you'd like to visit -- these are frequent conversation topics
- **Why it works:** Location is a constant trigger in daily life (weather, commute, local news).

### Michelob "Weekends Are Made for Michelob"
- Linked Michelob beer to weekends specifically
- Every Friday-Saturday-Sunday became a trigger for the brand
- **Why it works:** Weekly recurring trigger linked to a natural consumption occasion.

## Application Patterns

### Pattern 1: Identify Existing Triggers
**When to use:** Any product or content strategy
**How to apply:**
1. Map out your target audience's daily routine: wake up, commute, meals, work breaks, evening
2. List environmental stimuli they encounter at each stage
3. Identify which stimuli could naturally link to your product
4. Select the most FREQUENT one (daily > weekly > monthly > seasonal)

### Pattern 2: Grow the Habitat
**When to use:** When your product lacks natural triggers or has seasonal/rare ones
**How to apply:**
1. Choose a frequent environmental cue in your audience's life
2. Create content, campaigns, and messaging that repeatedly pair your brand with that cue
3. Reinforce the link across multiple channels (like Kit Kat did with coffee)
4. The link must feel natural, not forced -- find a genuine connection point
5. Be consistent over time -- it takes repetition to build the association

### Pattern 3: Time Your Triggers
**When to use:** Campaign scheduling and content calendar planning
**How to apply:**
1. Identify when your trigger occurs (morning, weekend, specific day, season)
2. Schedule your content and campaigns to be proximate to that trigger moment
3. For day-of-week triggers: post content on or just before that day
4. For seasonal triggers: begin messaging as the season approaches
5. For daily triggers: maintain constant presence during the trigger moment

### Pattern 4: Leverage Competitor-Free Triggers
**When to use:** Differentiation and positioning
**How to apply:**
1. Look for frequent stimuli that NO competitor has claimed
2. Own that association through consistent, repeated linking
3. The best triggers have few competing associations (coffee was "taken" by many brands, but "coffee break" paired with a snack bar was open for Kit Kat)
4. First mover advantage: once you own a trigger, it's hard for competitors to break

### Pattern 5: Engineer Trigger Proximity
**When to use:** Point-of-sale, decision moments, content consumption
**How to apply:**
1. Place your trigger as close as possible to where the desired action happens
2. In-store: near checkout, near the triggered category
3. Online: in content consumed during the trigger moment (morning emails for breakfast products)
4. Physical: where people encounter the environmental cue (gym, office, kitchen)

> "Top of mind means tip of tongue."

> "Triggers are the foundation of word of mouth... Social Currency gets people talking, but Triggers keep them talking."

> "Cheerios... is not as interesting as Disney World. But it is triggered much more frequently... and that matters for word of mouth."

> "Rather than just going for a catchy message, consider the context. Think about whether the message will be triggered by the everyday environments of the target audience."

> "Even boring products can get lots of word of mouth if they happen to be triggered by the right environmental cue."
