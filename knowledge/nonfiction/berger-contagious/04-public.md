- **STEPPS Position:** P (fourth principle)

## Core Concept

People imitate what they can see. If something is built to show, it's built to grow. The more observable a product, idea, or behavior is, the more likely others are to imitate it. Conversely, private behaviors and invisible products struggle to spread through social influence.

> "Making things more observable makes them easier to imitate, which makes them more likely to become popular."

The principle has two components:
1. **Observable behavior spreads** - People use others' actions as information about what is good, correct, or desirable (social proof)
2. **Behavioral residue persists** - Physical traces of behavior continue to advertise long after the initial action

## Key Principles

### 1. Monkey See, Monkey Do (Social Proof)

People look to others' behavior as a signal of what they should do, especially under uncertainty. If a behavior is visible, it creates a self-reinforcing cycle: visibility leads to imitation, which leads to more visibility.

**Key insight:** The problem is that many behaviors are private. People can't imitate what they can't see. The solution is to make the private public -- create visible signals of otherwise invisible behaviors.

### 2. Self-Advertising Products

Some products advertise themselves through use. Every time someone uses them, they are visible to others and create awareness.

**Design principle:** Build products that advertise themselves when consumed. The act of using the product should be visible and distinctive.

### 3. Behavioral Residue

Behavioral residue is the physical trace that remains after a behavior occurs. It continues to promote the behavior even when the person is not actively engaged.

**Examples of behavioral residue:**
- A Livestrong wristband continues to signal support even when the wearer isn't thinking about cancer
- An "I Voted" sticker continues to encourage voting all day long
- A branded tote bag continues to advertise every time it's carried

**Key insight:** Behavioral residue is more powerful than behavior itself because it persists. One act of voting lasts seconds; the "I Voted" sticker lasts all day.

### 4. Making the Private Public

Many things people think, believe, or do are invisible to others. Making them visible can dramatically increase their spread.

**The challenge:** Most preferences, opinions, and health behaviors are private. You can't see what someone thinks about a product, whether they donate to charity, or what health choices they make.

**The solution:** Create public signals for private behaviors -- wristbands, bumper stickers, visible product design, public pledges.

### 5. The Anti-Drug PSA Problem (Observability Backfire)

Making behavior visible can BACKFIRE when it involves undesirable behavior. Berger's key cautionary example:

Anti-drug campaigns that showed how many teenagers use drugs actually INCREASED drug use. By making drug use visible (even in a negative context), they communicated that drug use was common, which normalized it via social proof.

**Rule:** If the behavior you're trying to reduce is more common than people think, DO NOT make it visible. Instead, highlight the desirable behavior's prevalence.

## Examples from the Book

### Apple Logo Flip (Laptop Design)
- Original Apple laptops had the logo right-side-up for the user when the laptop was closed
- Problem: when opened and being used, the logo appeared upside-down to everyone else
- Apple reversed the logo orientation so it's right-side-up for observers, not the user
- **Why it works:** The laptop lid is a billboard. Making the logo visible to others (not the owner) turns every user into a walking advertisement. Self-advertising product design.

### Movember (Mustache Campaign)
- Men grow mustaches during November to raise awareness for prostate cancer
- Raised $174 million worldwide
- The mustache is inherently visible -- you can't hide it on your face
- Every conversation about "why are you growing that?" becomes a word-of-mouth moment
- **Why it works:** Making the private (support for cancer research) public (a visible mustache). The mustache IS the advertisement, and it prompts questions that spread the message.

### Livestrong Yellow Wristbands
- Lance Armstrong Foundation sold yellow silicone wristbands for $1 each
- Sold 85 million wristbands
- The bright yellow color was distinctive and visible on anyone's wrist
- People who saw others wearing them wanted one too -- social proof cycle
- **Why it works:** Behavioral residue. The wristband persists all day, every day. It makes the private (cancer support) public. And its distinctive color makes it impossible to confuse with anything else.

### Hotmail Email Signatures
- Every email sent from Hotmail included a footer: "Get your free e-mail at Hotmail"
- Each email was a self-advertising product -- the act of USING the product advertised it
- Grew from zero to 8.5 million users in one year, then 12 million users
- **Why it works:** Classic self-advertising product. Every use = one more impression. The recipient saw the ad at the exact moment they were most likely to need email (they were already reading email).

### iPod White Headphones
- Apple deliberately made iPod headphones white when all other headphones were black
- The white headphones became a visible signal: "I own an iPod"
- Social proof: seeing many people with white headphones made the iPod seem popular and desirable
- **Why it works:** Observable product design. The headphones were the public-facing element of a private music-listening behavior. Distinctive color = instant brand recognition.

### "I Voted" Stickers
- Polling stations give voters "I Voted" stickers
- Berger's research: the stickers increase voter turnout by making the private behavior of voting visible
- Seeing many stickers communicates "lots of people are voting" = social proof to vote
- **Why it works:** Behavioral residue. The vote itself is invisible (secret ballot), but the sticker makes it public all day. Seeing others' stickers triggers the social norm of civic participation.

### Anti-Drug PSAs (Backfire Effect)
- Montana Meth Project and similar campaigns showed the consequences of drug use
- Statistics like "most teenagers have tried drugs" were used to scare
- RESULT: Teenage drug use INCREASED after exposure to these campaigns
- The campaigns inadvertently communicated that drug use was NORMAL (common behavior = social proof to imitate)
- **Why it works (in reverse):** By making the undesirable behavior publicly visible and seemingly common, they triggered social proof in the wrong direction. Rule: never publicize the prevalence of a behavior you want to reduce.

### Koreen's "Please Don't Take Petrified Wood" Signs
- In the Petrified Forest, signs warned visitors not to take petrified wood
- The signs implied that many people DO take wood (otherwise why the sign?)
- Theft INCREASED compared to areas without signs
- **Why it works (in reverse):** Same backfire effect. The warning made the undesirable behavior seem common, normalizing it.

## Application Patterns

### Pattern 1: Design Self-Advertising Products
**When to use:** Product design, digital products, physical goods
**How to apply:**
1. Make the act of using your product visible to non-users
2. Add distinctive visual markers (Apple's white headphones, Louboutin's red soles)
3. For digital products: add "Sent via [Product]" signatures, visible badges, or sharing prompts
4. For services: create physical artifacts that signal usage (tote bags, stickers, wristbands)
5. Test: "Can a bystander tell that someone is using my product?" If not, redesign for visibility.

### Pattern 2: Create Behavioral Residue
**When to use:** Campaigns, cause marketing, community building
**How to apply:**
1. Create a physical or digital artifact that persists after the initial behavior
2. Wristbands, stickers, badges, profile frames, email signatures, tote bags
3. The artifact must be:
   - Visible in everyday contexts (not hidden in a drawer)
   - Distinctive enough to be noticed and prompt questions
   - Low-effort to display (wearing a wristband is easier than wearing a t-shirt)
4. The artifact should trigger conversations: "What's that?" → explanation → word of mouth

### Pattern 3: Make the Private Public
**When to use:** When the behavior or preference you want to spread is normally invisible
**How to apply:**
1. Identify the private behavior you want to encourage (donation, voting, healthy eating, product preference)
2. Create a public signal that represents it (badges, visible choices, public pledges)
3. Make the public signal socially desirable (not embarrassing)
4. Make adoption easy (free, low-effort, instantly available)
5. The signal must be visible in contexts where others can see and imitate

### Pattern 4: Avoid Observability Backfire
**When to use:** When trying to reduce an undesirable behavior or when the negative behavior is common
**How to apply:**
1. NEVER publicize how common an undesirable behavior is ("80% of people don't recycle" = bad)
2. INSTEAD publicize how common the DESIRABLE behavior is ("Most people in your neighborhood recycle" = good)
3. Focus messaging on the positive norm, not the negative one
4. If the undesirable behavior is actually rare, you CAN publicize that rarity ("Only 5% of students binge drink")
5. Test: "Does this message make the bad behavior seem more or less normal?"

### Pattern 5: Distinctive Observable Design
**When to use:** Any product or campaign where visibility matters
**How to apply:**
1. Choose a distinctive visual element that sets your product apart (color, shape, sound)
2. Make it visible during use, not just at purchase
3. Ensure it's different enough from competitors that observers can identify your brand specifically
4. Consistency is critical: the same distinctive element across all products and touchpoints
5. The distinctive element should be on the PUBLIC-facing side (Apple logo on laptop lid, not keyboard)
