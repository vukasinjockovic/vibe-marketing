## The Master Principles

> "If you confuse, you'll lose."

> "Your customer should be the hero of the story, not your brand. This is the secret every phenomenally successful business understands."

> "Pretty websites don't sell things. Words sell things. And if we haven't clarified our message, our customers won't listen."

> "The human brain, no matter what region of the world it comes from, is drawn toward clarity and away from confusion."

## On Story and Noise

> "Story is the greatest weapon you have to combat noise because it organizes information in such a way that people are compelled to listen."

> "Noise has killed more ideas, products, and services than taxes, recessions, lawsuits, climbing interest rates, and even inferior product design."

> "Story formulas put everything in order so the brain doesn't have to work to understand what's going on."

> "What we think we are saying to our customers and what our customers actually hear are two different things."

## On Survival

> "All great stories are about survival -- either physical, emotional, relational, or spiritual. A story about anything else won't captivate an audience."

> "Without us knowing it, human beings are constantly scanning their environment (even advertising) for information that is going to help them meet their primitive need to survive."

> "People don't buy the best products; they buy the products they can understand and apply to their lives the fastest."

## On Problems and Villains

> "Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but people buy solutions to internal problems."

> "The more we talk about the problems our customers experience, the more curiosity they will have about our brand."

> "The villain is the number one device storytellers use to give conflict a clear point of focus."

## On the Guide

> "Customers aren't looking for another hero; they're looking for a guide."

> "The day we stop losing sleep over our problems and start losing sleep over our customers' problems is the day our business will transform into a brand customers love."

> "The fatal mistake many brands make, especially young brands who believe they have something to prove, is positioning themselves as the hero in the story rather than the guide."

> "In stories, the hero is never the strongest character."

## On Plans and CTAs

> "Customers trust a guide who gives them a plan."

> "Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action."

> "When a customer says, 'Let me think about it,' what they are really saying is that they've got some cognitive dissonance and could use some space before making a buying decision."

## On Stakes

> "Every human being is trying to avoid a tragic ending to their story."

> "Fear is salt in the recipe."

> "Brands that don't paint the stakes fail to answer the 'so what' question every customer is secretly asking."

> "The deeper the hole your hero transcends, the more powerful and positive the perceived outcome."

## On Success and Transformation

> "Never assume people understand how your brand can change their lives for the better. Tell them."

> "Everybody wants to be taken somewhere, and if we fail to tell people where we are capable of taking them, they will engage another brand."

> "A hero needs somebody else to step into the story to tell them they've transformed. Heroes do not realize their transformation intuitively."

## On Messaging Discipline

> "Think of your communication campaign as an exercise in memorization."

> "Nobody will listen to you if your message isn't clear, no matter how expensive your marketing collateral may be."

> "Don't be clever; be clear."

> "The fewer words you use, the more likely it is that people will read them."

> "You are doing everything to prepare this man to be president and nothing to get him elected." (Miller to a presidential campaign)
