# The One-Liner Formula

**Source:** Building a StoryBrand 2.0 by Donald Miller (2025)
**Type:** Elevator pitch structure
**Purpose:** Answer "What do you do?" in a way that makes people want to buy

---

## Structure

```
PROBLEM + PRODUCT AS SOLUTION + RESULT
```

### Part 1: The Problem (The Hook)
Start with the problem your customer faces. This triggers the mental response: "Yeah, I struggle with that. Tell me more."

### Part 2: Product as Solution (Keep It Brief)
Simply state: "That's why we created X" and stop. Do NOT ramble about features. Just name it.

### Part 3: The Result (Vision of Success)
Cast a clear vision for how life looks after the problem is solved.

## Formula

```
"[Customer type] struggle with [problem].
[Product name] helps them [solution].
So they can [result/transformed life]."
```

## Examples from the Book

**Toothpaste:**
"Many people have sensitive teeth and gums and experience pain when brushing their teeth. Our new toothpaste is gentle on teeth and gums."

**Regenerative Ranching:**
"More and more people want to know where their beef comes from because industrialized ranching practices can leave toxins in our food. Regenerative ranching practices ensure animals are toxin-free, which means you don't struggle with food allergies and feel much better over time."

**Problem-first openers:**
- "If you're a busy mom and can't find time to work out, then..."
- "If your dog barks loudly whenever somebody knocks on the door, then..."
- "If you want the benefits of an electric vehicle but worry about range, then..."

## Derived from Movie Loglines

The one-liner is adapted from the screenwriting concept of a "logline" -- a single statement that communicates the entire movie plot. Examples:

- Tommy Boy: "An incompetent, immature, and dimwitted heir to an auto-parts factory must save the business to keep it out of the hands of his new con-artist relatives."
- Star Wars: "A naive but ambitious farm boy discovers powers he never knew he had when he teams up with a feisty princess and an old wizard warrior to lead a rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire."

## Testing Your One-Liner

- Run it by friends, spouse, potential customers, strangers at Starbucks
- Do they look interested? Do they understand what you offer?
- When they start asking for your business card, you've dialed it in
- Every team member should memorize and use it
