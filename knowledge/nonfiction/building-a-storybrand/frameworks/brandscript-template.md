## Usage Notes

- Create one BrandScript per brand, division, and product
- Start with the overall brand, then create sub-BrandScripts
- Treat as a rough draft -- keep editing until sound bites get the reaction you want
- All marketing collateral should trace back to the BrandScript
- The BrandScript is the "drum kit"; all marketing is a "drum solo"
