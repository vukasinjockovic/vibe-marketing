# SB7 Framework (StoryBrand 7-Part Framework)

**Source:** Building a StoryBrand 2.0 by Donald Miller (2025)
**Type:** Narrative marketing framework
**Purpose:** Structure any marketing message using the seven elements of story

---

## The Formula

> "A character who wants something encounters a problem before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a guide steps into their lives, gives them a plan, and calls them to action. That action helps them avoid failure and experience a success."

## The Seven Elements

### 1. A CHARACTER (The Customer)
- The customer is the hero, not the brand
- Define ONE thing the customer wants
- Must connect to survival (financial resources, time, social networks, status, resources, generosity, meaning)
- Opens a "story gap" in the customer's mind

**Principle:** "The customer is the hero, not your brand."

### 2. HAS A PROBLEM
- **Villain:** Root source of conflict (singular, relatable, real)
- **External Problem:** The tangible, physical challenge
- **Internal Problem:** How the external problem makes them FEEL
- **Philosophical Problem:** Why this situation is simply wrong ("ought" / "shouldn't")

**Principle:** "Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems."

### 3. AND MEETS A GUIDE (The Brand)
- **Empathy:** "We understand how it feels to..."
- **Competency:** Testimonials, statistics, awards, press, logos

**Principle:** "Customers aren't looking for another hero; they're looking for a guide."

### 4. WHO GIVES THEM A PLAN
- **Process Plan:** 3-6 steps to buy or use the product
- **Agreement Plan:** Promises that alleviate fears
- Name the plan to formalize it

**Principle:** "Customers trust a guide who gives them a plan."

### 5. AND CALLS THEM TO ACTION
- **Direct CTA:** "Buy Now," "Schedule a Call," "Register Today"
- **Transitional CTA:** Free PDF, webinar, sample, free trial

**Principle:** "Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action."

### 6. THAT HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE
- 3-4 negative consequences of NOT buying
- Use moderate fear ("salt in the recipe")
- Loss aversion: people are 2-3x more motivated to avoid loss than achieve gain

**Principle:** "Every human being is trying to avoid a tragic ending to their story."

### 7. AND ENDS IN A SUCCESS
- Specific, clear vision of life AFTER purchase
- Close all three story loops (external, internal, philosophical)
- Three resolution types: status/power, completeness/union, self-realization/acceptance

**Principle:** "Never assume people understand how your brand can change their lives. Tell them."

## Bonus Elements (Added in 2.0)

### Identity Transformation
- FROM: [current identity] -> TO: [aspirational identity]
- "How does your customer want to be described by others?"

### Controlling Idea
- One repeatable sentence that captures the brand's story
- The "moral" of the story you invite customers into
- Must be immediately understood without explanation

## Validation: The Grunt Test

Within 5 seconds of looking at your website:
1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make my life better?
3. What do I need to do to buy it?

If a caveman can't grunt these back, the message fails.

## Key Rules

1. ONE desire per BrandScript (subplots come later)
2. ONE villain (not multiple)
3. The guide has empathy AND competency (both required)
4. Plans have 3-6 steps (fewer = confused; more = overwhelmed)
5. Direct CTA must be visually obvious (bright, different color)
6. Failure stakes use moderate fear (not zero, not excessive)
7. Success must be SPECIFIC ("a yard better than your neighbor's" not "a nice yard")
8. Repeat sound bites until customers can recite them back
