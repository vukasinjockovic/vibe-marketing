# Guide vs Hero

**Concept:** The most important positioning decision in brand messaging

## Core Idea

Every customer wakes up as the hero of their own story. When a brand positions itself as another hero, the customer perceives competition for scarce resources. When a brand positions itself as the guide, the customer perceives a trusted ally.

## The Hero (Customer)

- Weak, ill-equipped, filled with self-doubt
- Doesn't know how to solve the problem alone
- Needs encouragement and tools
- Experiences transformation by end of story
- Always the one pulling out the wallet

## The Guide (Brand)

- Strong, competent, empathetic
- Has already "been there and done that"
- Serves the hero's story, not their own
- Does NOT transform (only the hero transforms)
- Two required traits: empathy + competency

## Why Brands Fail as Heroes

1. Customers see the brand as a competitor, not an ally
2. In stories, the hero is the WEAKEST character (after the victim)
3. Heroes are uncertain -- guides are certain
4. If both hero and guide transform, the audience doesn't know who the story is about

## The Mary Poppins Test

Mary Poppins is "practically perfect in every way." She never explains herself. She never doubts. She serves the hero's (George Banks) transformation without transforming herself. This is how a guide should operate.

## The Tidal Cautionary Tale

Jay-Z positioned artists as heroes fighting for fair pay. Customers were the ones buying music but were never positioned as the heroes. Tidal should have positioned fans as heroes getting "Music the way it was meant to be heard." The brand sold for $350M but should have sold for billions.

## Empathy + Competency (Amy Cuddy Research)

People subconsciously ask two questions when meeting someone new:
1. "Can I trust this person?" -> Answered by EMPATHY
2. "Can I respect this person?" -> Answered by COMPETENCY

Empathy establishes trust first. Only then does competency matter.

## Empathy Expressions

- "We understand how it feels to..."
- "Nobody should have to experience..."
- "Like you, we are frustrated by..."
- Finding and expressing commonality with the customer

## Competency Evidence

1. **Testimonials** (3 short ones, speak to problem solved)
2. **Statistics** ("125,000 users trust...")
3. **Awards** (small logos at bottom of page)
4. **Press Mentions** ("Featured by...")
5. **Client Logos** (social proof for B2B)
