# Three Levels of Problem

**Source:** Building a StoryBrand 2.0 by Donald Miller (2025)
**Concept:** Every customer faces external, internal, and philosophical problems simultaneously

---

## The Three Levels

### 1. External Problem
The tangible, physical, surface-level problem. The thing most businesses sell solutions to.

Examples:
- Hunger (restaurant)
- Leaky pipe (plumber)
- Need a car (dealership)
- Unsightly home (house painter)

### 2. Internal Problem
How the external problem makes the customer FEEL. This is the deeper motivator and the one most businesses miss.

> "Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but people buy solutions to internal problems."

Examples:
- Intimidated by technology (Apple's insight)
- Embarrassed about ugly lawn (landscaping)
- Helpless about needing childcare (nanny service)
- Fear of being lied to by a salesman (CarMax's insight)

**Key Question:** "What does this problem make our customers feel?"

### 3. Philosophical Problem
Why this situation is simply WRONG. Uses "ought" and "shouldn't" language. Gives the story deeper meaning and turns customers into brand evangelists.

Examples:
- "Bad people shouldn't be allowed to win"
- "People ought to be treated fairly"
- "I shouldn't have to be a barista to make gourmet coffee at home" (Nespresso)
- "My choice of car ought to help save the environment" (Tesla)
- "Everybody deserves to work for a great manager"
- "Pets deserve to eat healthy food too"

## The Perfect Brand Promise

Resolve ALL THREE levels in a single message or "obligatory scene."

**Star Wars Example:**
Luke shoots the proton torpedo through the Death Star exhaust port:
- External: Destroys the Death Star
- Internal: Proves he has what it takes to be a Jedi
- Philosophical: Good triumphs over evil

**Toothpaste Example:**
"When you brush with Gel Fresh, you get clean teeth without the harmful effects (external) and will feel better about how you're taking care of yourself (internal) because you shouldn't have to compromise your overall health just to have a great smile (philosophical)."

## Why This Matters for Pricing

> "Understanding and talking about our customers' internal problems does more than create better advertising. Framing our products as a resolution to both external and internal problems increases the perceived value of those products."

Starbucks charges $5 for coffee that used to cost $0.50 because they solve the internal problem (wanting to feel sophisticated in a comfortable environment).
