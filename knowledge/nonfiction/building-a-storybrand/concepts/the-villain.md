# The Villain

**Source:** Building a StoryBrand 2.0 by Donald Miller (2025)
**Concept:** The root cause of the customer's problem, personified

---

## Purpose

The villain gives the customer's problem a focal point. It makes the problem tangible, relatable, and defeatable. Products become weapons the customer uses to fight the villain.

## Four Characteristics of a Good Villain

1. **Root Source** -- Not a symptom. High taxes are not a villain; the broken government is.
2. **Relatable** -- Customers immediately recognize and disdain it.
3. **Singular** -- One villain. Multiple villains = lack of clarity.
4. **Real** -- Never fearmonger. Plenty of real villains exist.

## Examples from the Book

| Brand | Villain |
|-------|---------|
| Tesla | Gas-guzzling, inferior technology |
| Nespresso | Coffee machines that make bad coffee |
| Edward Jones | Financial firms that don't listen |
| Time management software | "Time thieves" (pointless meetings, chatty coworkers) |
| Government agency | Authoritarian regimes threatening democracy |

## How Villains Connect to Three Problem Levels

The villain causes an EXTERNAL problem, which triggers an INTERNAL feeling, which violates a PHILOSOPHICAL principle.

Example (The King's Speech):
- Villain: The stutter / the looming Nazi threat
- External: Cannot deliver a speech
- Internal: Self-doubt about wearing the crown
- Philosophical: Good must triumph over evil

## The Villain Doesn't Have to Be Serious

Sports rivalries, dust bunnies in animated gangs, fuzzy hairballs with squeaky voices in drains. Personifying everyday problems as villains is a proven advertising technique.

## Key Rule

> "If your customer wasn't experiencing some sort of pain or frustration as it relates to your brand, they wouldn't be seeking you out anyway."
