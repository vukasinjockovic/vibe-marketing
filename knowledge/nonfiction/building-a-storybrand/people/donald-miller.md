## Philosophy

- "If you confuse, you'll lose."
- Marketing is not about your story; it's about the customer's story.
- Clear beats clever. Simple beats comprehensive.
- Your communication campaign is a memorization exercise.
- The day you start losing sleep over your customers' problems instead of your own is the day your business transforms.
