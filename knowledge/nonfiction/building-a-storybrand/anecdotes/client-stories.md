- Connected to survival: family bonding, passing love to children
- Result: 99% increase in overall sales in test market

### Kyle Shultz -- Photography Course
- Problem: $25K first launch to email list. Not enough to quit firefighting job.
- Intervention: Rewrote sales page night before second launch using SB7. Removed 90% of text. Replaced "f-stop" and "depth of field" with "Take those great pictures where the background is blurry."
- Result: $103K to the SAME email list. Quit his job. Runs Shultz Photo School full-time.

- Problem: Mission was "make gardening ordinary" but nobody wakes up wanting that.
- Intervention: Bought StartAGarden.com. Positioned as: "If you want to start a garden, go see Nicole."
- Result: Poised to quadruple revenue. On track to be a household name.

### Vitality Aesthetics
- Problem: Header said "Your Natural Beauty." Business was strong but stagnant.

- Result: Business growth resumed through automated email campaigns.

### Calix Sales Training

- Result: Closed $2.5M+ in sales from emails sent during that single hour.

### MaxStrength Fitness
- Problem: Differentiator (20-minute workouts, twice a week) was buried below the fold.
- Intervention: Made "twenty minutes, twice" the controlling idea. Featured in header and repeated throughout.
- Result: Clear messaging became the growth engine for the franchise.

### Industrial Painting Company
- Problem: Website featured fine-arts painting of building. Looked like Italian restaurant. "Do you serve free breadsticks?"
- Intervention: Proposed replacing with image of guy in lab coat + "We Paint All Kinds of S#*%" + "Get a Quote" button.
- Result: Entire workshop agreed the simple message would increase engagement.

### Luxury Resort
- Problem: Marketing showed images of restaurant, front desk, staff. Positioned brand as hero.
- Intervention: Changed to images of warm bath, plush towels, massage, rocking chair. Header: "Find the luxury and rest you've been looking for."
- Result: Message defined culture. Every team member could state what customers want: luxury and rest.

## Brand Examples (Identity & Messaging)
