## Summary
Eugene M. Schwartz (1927-1995) was a legendary direct-response copywriter and advertising theorist. He authored *Breakthrough Advertising* (1966), which codified the first systematic framework for matching copy strategy to market conditions. His analytical approach to advertising -- classifying markets by awareness and sophistication stages, and codifying seven named body-copy techniques -- was unprecedented and remains foundational to direct-response marketing.

## Key Findings / What He Contributed
1. Created the Five Stages of Awareness taxonomy for matching headline strategy to prospect knowledge level.

2. Created the Five Stages of Market Sophistication taxonomy for adapting copy as markets mature.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 3

3. Identified and named seven body-copy techniques (Intensification, Identification, Gradualization, Redefinition, Mechanization, Concentration, Camouflage) that had never been formally described before.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 7-13

4. Formulated the Channeling Principle: copy cannot create desire, only channel existing mass desire.

5. Earlier books included *How to Double Your Child's Grades in School* and *How to Double Your Power to Learn*.

## Key Quotes
> "Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already-existing desires onto a particular product."

> "I have never heard, or read, a discussion of many of these techniques before. Therefore, they are not part of the common advertising terminology, and in case after case actually have no names."
