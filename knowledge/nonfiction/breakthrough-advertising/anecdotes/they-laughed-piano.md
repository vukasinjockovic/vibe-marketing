## Summary
One of the most famous ads in direct-response history, written for the U.S. School of Music correspondence course. Schwartz uses it as a premier example of a Stage 5 (Completely Unaware) identification headline. Rather than directly promising "learn piano by mail," the ad projects an ultimate triumph the prospect identifies with: the fantasy of shocking everyone with hidden talent. The narrative style (first-person confession) was state-of-the-art for the 1920s.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. Demonstrates "Projecting an Ultimate Triumph That the Prospect Will Identify With" -- a Stage 5 headline strategy.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 2, ~line 3208

2. The headline never mentions the product, the school, or even music lessons -- it projects pure identification with the prospect's fantasy of triumph.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 2, ~line 3218

3. Schwartz notes the narrative style is "now old-hat" but the strategy still works -- style changes, strategy does not.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 2, ~line 3526

4. The ad uses progressive disclosure: identification -> growing awareness -> solution -> product. The product (U.S. School of Music) doesn't appear until deep in the body copy.
