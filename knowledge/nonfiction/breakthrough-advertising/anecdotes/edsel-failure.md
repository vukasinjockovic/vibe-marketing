## Summary
Schwartz's third cautionary tale for the Channeling Principle. The Edsel was "a good car, backed by a deluge of fine advertising" that died trying to fight the overwhelming switch in public demand toward cheap, simple, inexpensive-to-run compact cars. Schwartz uses the Edsel as the most dramatic proof that no amount of advertising spend can overcome mass desire flowing in the opposite direction.
