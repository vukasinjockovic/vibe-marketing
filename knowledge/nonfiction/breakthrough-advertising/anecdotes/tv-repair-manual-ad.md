**Aliases:** WHY HAVEN'T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS, TV Repair Book Ad, Television Repair Ad

## Summary
Schwartz's most detailed case study of the Architecture of Belief (Gradualization technique). This ad for a TV repair manual demonstrates the complete step-by-step structure for building belief before making claims. The headline makes no promise -- it implies foul play matching existing suspicion. Through inclusion questions, symptom catalogs, expert authority, paragraph parallelism, and disguised conclusions, the ad builds a stream of acceptances so powerful that by the time the actual product is introduced, the prospect is pre-sold.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. **Headline:** "WHY HAVEN'T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS?" -- No claim, no promise, just implication matching existing suspicion. (First acceptance.)
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 9, ~line 10266

2. **Inclusion question:** "Was your set purchased after the spring of 1947?" -- 95% answer Yes. (Second acceptance.)
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 9, ~line 10405

3. Demonstrates how the word "Then" in "Then here is the full, uncensored story..." implies exclusion and adds credence to the following promise.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 9, ~line 10450

4. Shows the "Habit of Agreement" built through a stream of symptom questions (jumpy picture, lines, snow, etc.) that each earn a Yes.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 9, ~line 10500

5. Demonstrates disguised conclusions: "And, most important, these experts have discovered that you do not have to be a handyman..." -- an entirely new assumption presented as mere continuation.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 9, ~line 10700

6. Shows redefinition within gradualization: "repairs" become "adjustments," troubles become "warning signals" and "symptoms."
