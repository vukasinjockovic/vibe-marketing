# Volkswagen "Think Small" Campaign
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** VW Think Small, Volkswagen Campaign, VW Lemon Ad, VW Building-Block Ads

## Summary
Schwartz uses the Volkswagen magazine campaign as the premier example of the "product-as-focal-point" campaign strategy and the Creative Gamble. Each ad reveals a different facet of the car; no single phrase or slogan is repeated. The visual is always a close-up of the car against a bare background. Together, the series builds an overwhelming impression of "an Honest Car." Headlines like "Think Small," "Lemon," and "Our New Model" all take the Creative Gamble -- none mention product performance in the headline.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. Demonstrates "building-block ads" strategy: each ad is self-sufficient but the series compounds into an overwhelming impression.

2. Demonstrates the Creative Gamble: product name and performance absent from every headline.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 7, ~line 8277

3. Headlines include: "THINK SMALL" (merits of compactness), "Lemon" (microscopic flaw disqualifies car -- quality message), "Our new model" (no visible change, dozens of engineering improvements), "Why you should open the window before you close the door" (car is airtight = quality), "Our number one salesman" (the serviceman).

4. Used as a Camouflage example -- the understatement mood ("You never run out of air. You also won't have any worries about draining or flushing the radiator in spring. There is no radiator. Or hoses. Or water pump. Or rust.").

## Key Quotes
> "A series of building-block advertisements, making no attempt to tell the complete story in themselves, relying on their ability to grasp the prospective buyer and carry him through a procession of short, sharply focussed sales stories that combine to give an informed desire of tremendous depth."
