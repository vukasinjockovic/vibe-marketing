# "Often a Bridesmaid But Never a Bride"
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Bridesmaid Ad, Listerine Halitosis Ad, Edna's Case

## Summary
Classic Listerine mouthwash ad used by Schwartz as an example of "Projecting the Result of a Problem in Such a Way That It Will Be Identified With by People Who Would Reject a Direct Statement of the Problem Itself." The challenge: bad breath was too insulting a topic for direct treatment. Solution: project the RESULT of the problem (never getting married) rather than naming the problem itself. The prospect identifies with the character's plight, and the problem (halitosis) is introduced indirectly after identification is established.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. Demonstrates Stage 5 identification headline for a problem too embarrassing to state directly.

2. The headline projects a result (perpetual bridesmaid, never bride) that women identify with, then transitions to the cause (halitosis) only after emotional engagement.

3. Schwartz pairs this ad with the Piano ad to demonstrate that while narrative STYLE is now outdated, the STRATEGY (identification -> problem -> solution) remains permanently valid.
