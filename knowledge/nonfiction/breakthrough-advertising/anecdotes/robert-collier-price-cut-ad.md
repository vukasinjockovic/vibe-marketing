**Aliases:** Robert Collier Shirt Ad, Mill Overstock Ad, Madras Shirt Ad

## Summary
Schwartz uses a Robert Collier direct-mail piece as an example of how price cuts must be justified by a mechanism (a reason-why story). The ad for discounted woven Madras shirts starts with six full paragraphs explaining WHY the price was reduced -- a reliable mill overproduced, the weather was unseasonable, they were overstocked and needed money. Only after this mechanism is fully established does the copy move into the bargain claims. Schwartz argues this "mechanism-first" structure gives "ten times the believability for every word about bargain-value."

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. Demonstrates that "price cuts must be justified. There must be a reason for them. A mechanism behind them. Without such a mechanism... you are going to get only a fraction of its real sales power."

2. The mechanism (mill overstock story) precedes the bargain claims, providing a believability foundation.

## Key Quotes
> "A short time ago one of the old, reliable mills that makes the finer qualities of woven Madras for shirts began sending out S.O.S. calls..."
