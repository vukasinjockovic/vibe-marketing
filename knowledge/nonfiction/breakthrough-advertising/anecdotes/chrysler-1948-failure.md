## Summary
Schwartz's first cautionary tale illustrating the Channeling Principle: you cannot fight mass desire. In 1948, the American public wanted longer, lower, wider cars as symbols of rising living standards. Chrysler bucked the trend and offered a functional, practical car with more interior room but a shorter, squatter exterior. Despite a multimillion-dollar campaign by a top creative agency, the results were "catastrophic."

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. Demonstrates that advertising cannot create or redirect mass desire -- it can only channel existing desire.

2. Used alongside the Ford Safety Campaign and Edsel Failure as a trio of cautionary examples from the automotive industry.
