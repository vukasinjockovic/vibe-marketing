# Cigarette Industry Sophistication Cycle
**Type:** anecdote

**Aliases:** Cigarette Advertising History, Cigarette Industry Five Stages

## Summary
Schwartz uses the complete history of cigarette advertising as his primary case study for the Five Stages of Market Sophistication. The industry progressed from simple taste claims ("I'd Walk a Mile for a Camel!") through enlarged claims, new mechanisms ("Luckies -- They're Toasted!"), elaborated mechanisms, and finally pure identification (Marlboro "Virile Men" ads). The cancer scare then opened a new sub-market (filter cigarettes) that retraced the same five stages. Additionally, the women's smoking market was opened via a Stage-5 identification headline: "Blow Some My Way."
