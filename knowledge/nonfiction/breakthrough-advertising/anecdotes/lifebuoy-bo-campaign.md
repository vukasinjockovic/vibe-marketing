# Lifebuoy B.O. Campaign
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Lifebuoy Soap, B.O. Campaign, Lifebuoy Redefinition

## Summary
Schwartz uses Lifebuoy as a dual example: (1) a company that discovered a "previously unnoticed performance" to escape its old market entirely, and (2) the quintessential Redefinition -- turning a liability (strong medicinal odor) into an asset (proof of odor-destroying power). The B.O. campaign focused the prospect's attention on their OWN body odor, then positioned Lifebuoy's strong smell as evidence it was powerful enough to eliminate that odor. Schwartz calls it "concept-judo -- a complete reversal."
