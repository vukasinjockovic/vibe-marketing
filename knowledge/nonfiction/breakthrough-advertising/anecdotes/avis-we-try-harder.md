# Avis "We Try Harder" Campaign
**Type:** anecdote
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Avis Campaign, We Try Harder, We're Only Number Two

## Summary
Schwartz uses the Avis campaign as his primary example of Reinforcement -- the principle that "in emotional writing, one plus one can often equal ten." The campaign combined two statements: "We try harder" (good by itself) and "We're only second" (the reason why). Neither statement alone is extraordinary, but their juxtaposition creates compound impact far greater than the sum of parts. The second statement transforms the first from a generic claim into a believable, sympathetic, and compelling proposition.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. Demonstrates Reinforcement (1+1=10): two images joined in the right way have ten times the impact of either alone.

2. "We try harder" + "We're only second" = each statement intensifies the other through juxtaposition.
