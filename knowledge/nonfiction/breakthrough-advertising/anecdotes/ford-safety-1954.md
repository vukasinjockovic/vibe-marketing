## Summary
Schwartz's second cautionary tale illustrating the Channeling Principle. In 1954, cars had become universally long, and the public appraised each other's cars by horsepower. While Hudson Hornet, Cadillac, and Chrysler 300 rode the horsepower trend to millions in extra sales, Ford devoted millions to advertising safety. "The advertising ran into a wall of disinterest: results were non-existent." Ford reversed course the next year, producing and advertising the highest-horsepower engines in their history.
