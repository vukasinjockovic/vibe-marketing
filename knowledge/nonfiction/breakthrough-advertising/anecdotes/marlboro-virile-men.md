## Summary
Schwartz uses the Marlboro campaign as the defining example of both Stage 5 Market Sophistication (pure identification, no claims or mechanisms) and the technique of triple identification. When the cigarette industry could no longer differentiate on taste, mechanisms, or health claims, Marlboro shifted entirely to visual identification with virility. The campaign intensified a single dominant emotion -- virility -- through three simultaneous channels: the men themselves were virile, their occupations demanded virility, and the tattoo was a primitive symbol of virility.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. Demonstrates Stage 5 Sophistication: "no mechanisms or claims, without even headlines, simply by projecting strong visual identifications."
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 3, ~line 4270

2. Demonstrates triple identification -- one emotion symbolized three ways for compound impact.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 8, ~line 9131

3. Demonstrates the principle "A single dominant emotion -- virility -- symbolized three ways. The impact of repetition reinforced through variation."
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 8, ~line 9131

4. Also used as an example of "Projecting hidden desire that cannot be verbalized" in Stage 5 Awareness headlines (Ch. 2, ~line 3040).
