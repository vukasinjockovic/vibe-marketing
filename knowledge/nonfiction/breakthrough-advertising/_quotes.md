## On the Nature of Advertising
> "Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already-existing desires onto a particular product."

> "We can define this Mass Desire quite simply. It is the public spread of a private want."

> "When it tries to create this desire, it is no longer advertising but education. And, as education, it can produce at best only one dollar in sales for every dollar spent on advertising."

> "Advertising is salesmanship in print. Therefore, above everything else, advertising is the literature of desire. It is society's encyclopedia of dreams."

> "No successful copy ever sells a product. It sells a way of satisfying a particular desire."

> "In effective advertising, though styles may change, strategy does not."

## On the Copywriter's Job
> "You are literally the script writer for your prospect's dreams. You are the chronicler of his future."

> "Your headline has only one job -- to stop your prospect and compel him to read the second sentence of your ad."

> "To attempt to do the same selling job in ten words, instead of a hundred, or a thousand, is to shoot craps with your client's money."

> "What you are looking for in this product and this market is the one element that makes them unique."

## On Desire and Identification
> "No matter what you do, your prospect will take with him only one basic idea, one dominant image from your ad."

> "You cannot repeat, but you can reinforce."

> "At least half of all purchases made today cannot be understood in terms of function alone."

> "The force that creates sales, that powers our present economy, is desire."

## On Beliefs and Persuasion
> "If you violate your prospect's established beliefs in the slightest degree -- either in content or direction -- then nothing you promise him, no matter how appealing, can save your ad."

> "One fully-believed promise has ten times the sales power of ten partially-believed promises."

> "Effective advertising, like effective literature, is built -- not of words -- but of reactions."

> "If you demand that your prospect jump across a believability-chasm, your ad will fail. If, however, you build a bridge of ideas or images across that chasm -- starting on his side -- then he will let you lead him almost anywhere."

> "You cannot contradict accepted images or beliefs in advertising. This is not advertising's role."

> "Innovation without acceptance is valueless."

## On Redefinition and Objections
> "A simple concept-judo. A complete reversal. Turning a liability into an asset, with a single idea."

## On Competition
> "Never attack a weakness unless you can provide the solution to that weakness at the same time!"

## On Copy Craft
> "In mathematics, one plus one always equals two -- never more. In emotional writing, one plus one can often equal ten."

> "Position increases power."

> "A new structure is a new ad."

> "Words and rhythms. They are to the copy writer what line and color are to the painter."

> "Advertising, like science, must accept reality as it exists, not as it might wish it to exist. Only then can it alter reality -- not by smashing into it head-on -- but by exploiting its tendencies and giving direction to its energies."

## On the Logic of Language
> "These words have been used for centuries in court, in politics, in science -- even in detective stories -- to show others that proof has been offered, that reason has been used. Therefore, after centuries of conditioning, the words themselves -- regardless of the content of the statements to which they are attached -- now carry conviction."

## On Creativity
> "The more successful the copy writer, the greater the temptation to find his new headline in his old files. But it won't work. Copying can be done by any cub."

> "Keep reading. Keep analyzing. Keep writing. Keep looking for the new idea -- the million dollars hidden somewhere in that typewriter of yours. Always shoot for the moon -- it's one of the few real thrills left today!"
