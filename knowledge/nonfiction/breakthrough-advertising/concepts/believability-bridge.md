**Aliases:** Believability Bridge, Believability-Chasm, Bridge of Ideas, Primary Image Bridge

## Summary
Schwartz's metaphor for the requirement that copy must never force the prospect to "jump" from what they currently believe to what you want them to believe. Instead, the copywriter must build a bridge -- starting on the prospect's side (from what they already accept) and leading them step by step toward the new claim. The "believability-chasm" is the gap between the prospect's current beliefs and your intended claim. Many campaigns fail because they demand a leap the prospect refuses to make.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. "If you demand that your prospect jump across a believability-chasm, your ad will fail. If, however, you build a bridge of ideas or images across that chasm -- starting on his side -- then he will let you lead him almost anywhere."
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 8, ~line 9641

2. The concept applies to both identification images and performance claims. A product image too far from the prospect's reality causes disbelief that spreads to all claims.

3. The "primary image" of a product is the starting point of the bridge -- what the prospect already believes about the product. You cannot contradict it; you can only build on it.
