# The Creative Gamble
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Creative Gamble, Headline Gamble

## Summary
Schwartz's term for the strategic decision to use the headline solely to grasp attention and drive the prospect into the body copy, rather than attempting to make the complete selling message in the headline. The gamble: if it fails, the entire page is wasted; if it succeeds, the effectiveness of the ad doubles or triples because the prospect reads the full selling argument. This technique is most visible in campaigns like Volkswagen's "Think Small" where product name and performance are absent from the headline.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. "The copy writer is taking the position that he can only sell adequately with the number of words allowed him by the body copy. Therefore he is willing to risk his headline in grasping the attention of his prospect and impelling him to read on."

2. The gamble is justified when the selling story requires the full body copy to be persuasive -- particularly at Stage 5 awareness or Stage 5 sophistication.

3. VW "Think Small," "Lemon," and other headlines all take the Creative Gamble -- none mention product performance or trademark in the headline.
