**Aliases:** Three Dimensions, Desires-Identifications-Beliefs, D-I-B Framework

## Summary
Schwartz's model of the three psychological dimensions a copywriter must address: (1) Desires -- physical wants, needs, cravings that drive the prospect; (2) Identifications -- roles the prospect wants to play, personality traits he wants to project; (3) Beliefs -- opinions, attitudes, prejudices, fragments of knowledge the prospect lives by. The length and structure of any ad is determined by how much copy is needed to build desire, enable identification, and overcome/align with beliefs.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. Copy length depends on three factors: how much to build desire, how much for identification/comfort, how much to overcome beliefs/prejudices.

2. "You cannot create them, diminish them, or battle them. But you can expand them, sharpen them, channel them, and give them a goal." (on Desires)

3. "You start with these beliefs as a base. You build up from them by using his kind of logic, not your own." (on Beliefs)

4. Each dimension maps to specific techniques: Desires -> Intensification; Identifications -> Identification; Beliefs -> Gradualization.

## Key Quotes
> "Advertising, like science, must accept reality as it exists, not as it might wish it to exist. Only then can it alter reality -- not by smashing into it head-on -- but by exploiting its tendencies and giving direction to its energies."
