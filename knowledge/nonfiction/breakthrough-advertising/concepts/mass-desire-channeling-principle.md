# Mass Desire / The Channeling Principle
**Type:** concept
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Channeling Principle, Mass Desire, The Force That Makes Advertising Work, Amplification Effect

## Summary
Schwartz's foundational axiom: copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only channel pre-existing mass desire -- hopes, dreams, fears already shared by millions -- onto a particular product. The economic corollary is the Amplification Effect: advertising that channels existing desire produces $50-$100 in sales per $1 spent, while advertising that tries to create desire (i.e., education) produces at best $1 per $1 spent. Mass desire has three dimensions: urgency, staying power, and scope.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. "The power, the force, the overwhelming urge to own that makes advertising work, comes from the market itself, and not from the copy."

2. Mass desire = "the public spread of a private want."
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 1, ~line 1250

3. Three dimensions of mass desire: urgency (intensity), staying power (repetition/insatiability), scope (number of people sharing it).
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 1, ~line 1472

4. Two categories of mass desire forces: Permanent Forces (mass instinct, technological problems) and Forces of Change (trends, mass education).

5. The Amplification Effect: channeling produces 50-100x returns; education produces 1x returns.

## Key Quotes
> "Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already-existing desires onto a particular product."

> "When it tries to create this desire, it is no longer advertising but education. And, as education, it can produce at best only one dollar in sales for every dollar spent on advertising."

> "We can define this Mass Desire quite simply. It is the public spread of a private want."
