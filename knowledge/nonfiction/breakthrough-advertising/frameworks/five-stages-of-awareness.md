# Five Stages of Awareness
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** State of Awareness, Awareness Scale, Awareness Stages, Customer Awareness Spectrum, Schwartz Awareness Levels

## Summary
A taxonomy created by Eugene Schwartz classifying markets into five stages based on how much the prospect already knows about the product and the desire it satisfies. Each stage dictates a fundamentally different headline strategy. Moving between stages requires crossing a "psychological wall" -- a headline that works at one stage fails completely at another.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. **Stage 1 -- Most Aware:** Customer knows product, knows what it does, wants it, just hasn't bought. Headline = product name + bargain price.

2. **Stage 2 -- Product-Aware:** Knows product exists but isn't fully convinced. Headline = product name + superiority claim (7 sub-tasks).
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 2, ~line 2094

3. **Stage 3 -- Solution-Aware:** Knows what he wants done but doesn't know your product does it. Headline = name the desire/solution, prove it, show mechanism in your product.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 2, ~line 2306

4. **Stage 4 -- Problem-Aware:** Has a need but doesn't know a solution exists. Headline = name the need, dramatize it, present product as inevitable solution.

5. **Stage 5 -- Completely Unaware:** Not aware of desire/need or won't admit it. Headline = identification (echo emotion/attitude). Product appears only deep in body copy.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 2, ~line 2552

6. Each stage is separated by a "psychological wall" -- indifference on one side, intense interest on the other.

## Key Quotes
> "Each of these stages is separated from the others by a psychological wall. On one side of that wall is indifference; on the other, intense interest."

> "A headline which will work to a market in one stage of awareness will not work to a market in another stage of awareness. Nor will it work, even to a market in which it has been successful, once that market passes on to a new stage of awareness."

## Open Questions
- How does this framework map to modern digital funnel stages (TOFU/MOFU/BOFU)?
- Do social media platforms collapse the awareness stages by exposing prospects to later-stage content prematurely?
