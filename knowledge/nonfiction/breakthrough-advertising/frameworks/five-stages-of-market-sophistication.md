# Five Stages of Market Sophistication
**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** State of Sophistication, Sophistication Scale, Market Sophistication Stages, Schwartz Sophistication Levels

## Summary
A taxonomy created by Eugene Schwartz classifying markets by how many competing products and claims the prospect has already been exposed to. As sophistication increases, direct claims lose power and the copywriter must shift strategy: from simple claims (Stage 1) to enlarged claims (Stage 2) to new mechanisms (Stage 3) to elaborated mechanisms (Stage 4) to pure identification (Stage 5). The framework predicts the lifecycle of advertising in any product category.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. **Stage 1 -- First in Market (Virgin):** Be simple, direct. Name the desire or claim. No need for mechanisms or proof.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 3, ~line 3676

2. **Stage 2 -- Second in Market:** Copy the successful claim but enlarge it. Drive to absolute limit. Outbid competition.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 3, ~line 3716

3. **Stage 3 -- Claims Exhausted:** Introduce a NEW MECHANISM. The mechanism moves into the headline; the claim becomes shorthand. "Not accomplishment, but performance becomes dominant."
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 3, ~line 3896

4. **Stage 4 -- Mechanisms Competing:** Elaborate on the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer. Add benefits, remove limitations.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 3, ~line 4078

5. **Stage 5 -- Market Exhausted:** Shift from promise and mechanism to identification with the prospect. The market no longer believes advertising.
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 3, ~line 4144

6. The cigarette industry went through all five stages -- providing Schwartz's most complete case study.

## Key Quotes
> "The emphasis shifts from what the product does to HOW it works. Not accomplishment, but performance becomes dominant."

> "The emphasis shifts from the promise and the mechanism which accomplishes it, to identification with the prospect himself."

## Open Questions
- Can a market be "restarted" at Stage 1 through a genuinely new medium (e.g., filter cigarettes restarted the cycle)?
- How does the internet compress sophistication cycles compared to the print/TV era Schwartz analyzed?
