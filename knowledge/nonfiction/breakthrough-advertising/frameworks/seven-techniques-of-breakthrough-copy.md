**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** Seven Basic Techniques, Part 2 Techniques, Body Copy Techniques, Mechanisms of Persuasion

## Summary
Eugene Schwartz's master framework of seven named body-copy techniques for strengthening ad copy. These techniques address the three dimensions of the prospect's mind (Desires, Identifications, Beliefs) and are used in combination. Schwartz explicitly noted that many of these techniques had never been formally named or discussed before his book.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. **Intensification** (Ch. 7) -- Strengthening desire through 13 sub-techniques: direct description, product-in-action, bring in the reader, demonstration-test, stretch in time, bring in an audience, show experts, compare/contrast, heaven-or-hell, show ease, metaphor/analogy, catalog summary, guarantee as climax.

2. **Identification** (Ch. 8) -- Building a saleable personality into the product through character roles (adjectives: "progressive," "chic") and achievement roles (nouns: "Executive," "Home Owner").

3. **Gradualization** (Ch. 9) -- Making prospects believe claims before you state them, through the Architecture of Belief. Six devices: inclusion questions, detailed identification, contradiction of false beliefs, language of logic, syllogistic thinking, other belief forms.

4. **Redefinition** (Ch. 10) -- Removing objections by redefining the product. Three types: simplification (too hard), escalation (not important enough), price reduction (too expensive).

5. **Mechanization** (Ch. 11) -- Verbally proving the product works. Three stages: name the mechanism, describe the mechanism, feature the mechanism in the headline.

6. **Concentration** (Ch. 12) -- Destroying alternate ways to satisfy the desire. Two structures: interweaving contrast (bad-good-bad-good) and time-sequence (before/after).

7. **Camouflage** (Ch. 13) -- Borrowing conviction by adopting the format, phraseology, and mood of trusted communication channels.

## Key Quotes
> "I have never heard, or read, a discussion of many of these techniques before. Therefore, they are not part of the common advertising terminology, and in case after case actually have no names."
