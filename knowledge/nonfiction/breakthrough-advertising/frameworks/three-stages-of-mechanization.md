**Aliases:** Mechanization Stages, Mechanism Copy Stages, How to Verbally Prove Your Product Works

## Summary
Schwartz's framework for determining how much mechanism (explanation of HOW the product works) to include in copy, and where to place it. The three stages progress from simply naming the mechanism (when prospects already understand it) to describing it in selling language (when it's new) to featuring it in the headline itself (when it becomes the primary differentiator). The key rule: mechanism copy must never be merely factual -- it must sell, loaded with promise and emotion.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. **Stage 1: Name the Mechanism** -- When prospects already understand how the product works (from competitors' ads), simply name it. Compete on other factors.

2. **Stage 2: Describe the Mechanism** -- When the mechanism is new or not understood, describe how it works in selling language. "The first rule of mechanism copy is that it is not scientific discourse."
   -- Source: *Breakthrough Advertising*, Ch. 11, ~line 12611

3. **Stage 3: Feature the Mechanism in the Headline** -- When you have an exceptionally strong/dramatic mechanism, or market sophistication demands differentiation, the mechanism becomes the headline. Examples: "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY," "SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY."

4. Price cuts need mechanisms too: "Price cuts must be justified. There must be a reason for them. A mechanism behind them."

## Key Quotes
> "The first rule of mechanism copy is that it is not scientific discourse. You must never allow it to become dull, or merely factual. You must load it with promise, load it with emotion. Every word in good copy -- including mechanism copy -- sells."

> "Every one of them offers you a new way to get what you've been wanting. A NEW WAY: a new mechanism; a new chance to satisfy your desire -- even if everything else you've tried has failed you."

## Open Questions
- In SaaS marketing, does "how it works" content (product demos, technical walkthroughs) serve as modern mechanization?
