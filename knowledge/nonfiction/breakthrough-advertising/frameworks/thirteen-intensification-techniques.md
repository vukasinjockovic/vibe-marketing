**Type:** framework
**Status:** solid
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
**Aliases:** 13 Ways to Strengthen Desire, Intensification Sub-Techniques, Desire-Building Techniques

## Summary
Schwartz's catalog of 13 specific methods for building desire in body copy. Each technique presents the same dominant benefit from a different perspective -- the goal is reinforcement through variation, not repetition. The techniques range from direct product description to metaphor and imagination. The key principle: each additional perspective sharpens the same dominant image and builds emotional weight, but only if it is genuinely fresh.

## Key Findings / What It Illustrates
1. **Direct Description** -- Present the product or satisfaction directly, bluntly, with thorough detail.
2. **Product-in-Action** -- Show not just what the product does, but HOW it does it in motion.
3. **Bring In the Reader** -- Put the reader in the middle of the product-in-action story. First day of ownership.
4. **Demonstration-Test** -- Turn the demo into a test the reader can visualize performing.
5. **Stretch Benefits in Time** -- Extend benefits over weeks, months, years.
6. **Bring In an Audience** -- Celebrities (testimonial) or average people (case history).
7. **Show Experts Approving** -- "There is nothing so astounding as the astonishment of experts."
8. **Compare, Contrast, Prove Superiority** -- Lay old disadvantages beside new advantages.
9. **Picture the Black Side (Heaven-or-Hell)** -- Paint the negative, then apply the salve. Two motivational currents: repulsion + attraction.
10. **Show How Easy It Is** -- At every touchpoint: price, ease, durability, portability.
11. **Use Metaphor, Analogy, Imagination** -- Present facts in more dramatic form. Personify the product.
12. **Catalog Summary** -- Brief listing of all performances. Horizontal (expanding applications) or Vertical (deepening desire).
13. **Guarantee as Climax** -- Turn guarantee into the final summary of all performances, reinforced at every step.
