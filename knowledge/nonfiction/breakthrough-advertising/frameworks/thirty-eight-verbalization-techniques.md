## Summary
A catalog of 38 specific verbal techniques for increasing the impact of a headline once the strategic content has been determined. Schwartz distinguishes between headline CONTENT (what to say, determined by awareness and sophistication analysis) and headline FORM (how to say it, determined by verbalization). These techniques reinforce, freshen, or deepen the claim through sentence structure, metaphor, challenge, authority, and other devices.

2. Measure the speed: "FEEL BETTER FAST!"
3. Compare the claim: "SIX TIMES WHITER WASHES!"
4. Metaphorize: "BANISHES CORNS!" / "MELTS AWAY UGLY FAT!"
5. Sensitize (make sensory): "TASTES LIKE YOU JUST PICKED IT!"
6. Demonstrate by prime example: "AT 60 MILES AN HOUR, THE LOUDEST NOISE IN THIS ROLLS ROYCE IS THE ELECTRIC CLOCK!"
7. Dramatize the result: "THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO..."
