# Content Strategy

## Image Size

**Always use 1080 x 1350 pixels** (vertical). Takes up more screen space in the feed, drives higher engagement.

## 11 Content Formats (Ranked by Performance)

### Tier 1 — Highest performers

1. **Image + Text** — Most effective format for going viral. Emotional content, nostalgia, and questions perform best.
2. **Text-only posts** — Feel personal, like a direct thought. Simpler = easier to stop, read, react.
3. **Interactive content** — "Pick one among 4", "one has to go", "eliminate one", "choose one" + short caption.

### Tier 2 — Strong performers

4. **Trendy content** — Piggyback trending topics (celebrity news, events). People comment because it's relatable.
5. **Highly charged emotional content** — Anything that triggers feelings gets shared.
6. **Inspirational content** — Uplifting, shareable, consistent engagement.
7. **Nostalgic content** — "Good old days" content. Core Facebook audience is millennials/boomers.

### Tier 3 — Supplementary

8. **Timely celebrity quotes** — Tie quotes to current events.
9. **Thread posts** — Post main hook, then continue in comments (Part 1, 2, 3...). Can't be scheduled — manual only.
10. **Debate questions** — Source from Reddit AskReddit (sort by Top → All Time), adapt to niche.
11. **Carousel/Story posts** — Work well for self-improvement, education niches.

## Viral Triggers (What Makes Content Spread)

| Trigger | Why It Works |
|---|---|
| Emotion | "When people feel something, they share it. Emotion always beats logic for attention." |
| Nostalgia | Core FB audience is older — memories = shares |
| Questions | More comments → more reach → more money |
| Debate/Opinion | Polarizing (but non-toxic) sparks engagement |
| Relatability | "That's so me" content gets saved and shared |

## Content Sourcing (Not From Scratch)

> "I haven't created content from scratch in the last 3 years. I either curate it or use AI."

1. Follow 20 competitor pages — study what they post, when, and how
2. Use Strevio.com to spy on competitors' top-performing posts (free, up to 75 pages)
3. Reddit — sort subreddits by Top → All Time for proven viral ideas
4. Google Trends — "Trending Now" section, US, past 48 hours
5. TikTok Discover — hashtags in your niche for early trend spotting
6. AI rewrite — paste content into ChatGPT: "Rewrite this in a fresh, catchy way that avoids plagiarism"
