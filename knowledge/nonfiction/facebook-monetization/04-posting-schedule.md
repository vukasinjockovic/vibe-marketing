# Posting Schedule

## Optimal Times (EST — USA Time)

Post between **8:30 AM and 11:30 PM EST**.

### Golden hours (post your best content here)

| Time | Why |
|---|---|
| **8:30 AM** | First thing people see when they wake up |
| **8:30 PM** | People winding down, checking apps after work |
| **11:30 PM** | Late-night scrolling, especially weekends |

### The Half-Past Trick

> "I always post at half-past the hour because almost no one else is posting then. Most content creators post on the hour."

Tested and confirmed by author — half-past consistently outperforms on-the-hour posting.

## Frequency

| Stage | Posts/Day | Spacing |
|---|---|---|
| Starting out | 6-8 | One every 2 hours |
| Growing page | Up to 14 | 60 minutes between posts |

Schedule via Meta Business Suite (Facebook's free built-in tool).

## Reposting Strategy

> "Reposting = free money with less effort. If something went viral once, it can do it again."

### When to repost

- 2-4 weeks after original post date (never sooner)
- Same time slot/day that originally performed well
- During trending seasons (e.g., "fall recipes" every September)

### How to repost smart

- Change the hook or caption slightly to refresh
- Swap the thumbnail image if it's a video
- Use insights from original post: time, format, caption style

### Rules

- Only repost top 10% performers — be selective
- Never repost within 1 week — Facebook throttles repeated content
- Use Facebook Insights → Content tab → sort by Reach or Engagement to find winners
