## The Fast-Approval Method (Author's Exact Strategy)

> "I got 10 pages approved this way, each in less than 2 months."

### 4-Week Ad Ramp

| Week | Daily Spend | Weekly Total |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | $10 | $70 |
| Week 2 | $12 (+20%) | $84 |
| Week 3 | $14.40 (+20%) | $100.80 |
| Week 4 | $17.28 (+20%) | $120.96 |
| **Total** | | **~$376** |

### After Week 4

- Gradually reduce Page Like budget by 20% every 48 hours back to $5-$10/day
- Don't cut suddenly — Facebook needs to see steady momentum

### Week 4 Addition: Engagement Ads

- Start $3/day engagement campaign
- Change the post daily (edit campaign, swap creative)
- Run for the full week

### Why This Works

> "Facebook wants to see momentum in both follower growth AND engagement. 0 to 10K in a week looks spammy. Steady growth week by week looks organic and real."

### Throughout All 4 Weeks

- Post 6-8 viral content pieces daily, every single day
- Never stop posting after applying
- The invitation typically comes within 1-3 months

## Myths Debunked

- You do NOT need to be verified (none of author's pages are verified)
- Invites are NOT "in waves" — the program is always open
- Create multiple pages simultaneously to increase chances

## Pro Tip

> "To increase your chances, create another page and work on them simultaneously. Choose different niches."
