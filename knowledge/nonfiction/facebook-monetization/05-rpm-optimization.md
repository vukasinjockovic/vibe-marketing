# RPM Optimization

> "Most people think views alone decide how much money they make. That's wrong."

Earnings = Views x RPM. Same content can make 10x more with the right optimizations.

## 1. Country Restrictions (Biggest Lever)

Facebook pushes posts to low-RPM countries even if your page targets the US. This is the #1 reason pages get millions of views but earn little.

### Fix: Restrict your page to high-RPM countries

Go to: Page Settings → Country Restrictions

**Target these countries:**
- United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany
- Other high-RPM Tier 1 countries

**At minimum:** Ban countries not eligible for Content Monetization Program.

> "Pages that ignore this setting bleed money without knowing why."

## 2. Niche = RPM Ceiling

| High RPM | Low RPM |
|---|---|
| Finance, Business | Random memes |
| Self-improvement | Generic entertainment |
| Education, Technology | Reposted viral clips (no theme) |
| Health & Fitness | Celebrities |
| Food & Recipes | |

> "If your goal is money, your niche choice matters more than going viral."

## 3. Captions (Direct RPM Impact)

Captions affect: Dwell time, Engagement, Distribution, Monetization.

Facebook reads captions to match your page with the right advertisers/bidders.

### Good captions do 4 things:

1. Hook attention in the first line
2. Give context without over-explaining
3. Push interaction naturally
4. **Include high-RPM keywords** (this is how Facebook matches you to higher-paying advertisers)

## 4. TOBI (Text Overlay on Images)

Text overlay clarity affects how Facebook categorizes and distributes your content. Keep text on images clear, readable, and keyword-relevant.

## The RPM Formula

> "Facebook monetization is not luck. It is small decisions stacking together: Audience location + Niche strength + Caption quality + Text overlay clarity."
