# Scaling to $10K/Month

## Vertical Scaling (Same Page, More Revenue)

### Reinvest 20% of Revenue

| Allocation | % | What |
|---|---|---|
| Page Like campaigns | 15% | Gain new followers in same country |
| Engagement ads | 5% | $3 engagement ads, swap post every 24h, 2-3x/week |

### Maximize Existing Content

- **Repost proven viral content** from 1-3 months ago
- **Share daily in Facebook groups** (including your own)
- **Cross-post to other niche pages** you own — tailor to each audience

## Horizontal Scaling (More Pages, More Revenue)

### 1. Multilingual Twin Pages

- Launch "twin" pages in other languages (e.g., Spanish for Spain + Latin America)
- Translate top-performing content, adapt to cultural nuances
- Apply the same growth strategies

### 2. New Niches or Sub-Niches

- Use insights from primary page to pick related niches
- Example: Fitness page → expand into Nutrition or Home Workouts
- Each new page = another revenue stream

## Blog/Website Revenue Layer

### Setup

- Blog monetized with Google AdSense, Ezoic, or Mediavine
- Or: niche store (dropshipping, print-on-demand, affiliate products)
- Or: review site with Amazon, ClickBank, ShareASale affiliates
- Must be mobile-friendly (90%+ of Facebook traffic is mobile)

### Traffic Strategy

**Never put links in captions** — Facebook throttles reach.

Instead:
1. Write a teaser caption (~150 characters)
2. Add "Full article in the first comment"
3. Drop the link in first comment

### Blog Post Title Formulas That Drive Traffic

|---|---|
| Financial angles | "How Much Money X Makes", "Why X Is So Expensive" |
| Insider secrets | "Experts Share Their Tips for X", "Secret Hacks to X" |
| Things to avoid | "The Worst X for X", "Biggest Mistakes When X" |
| Myths & truths | "Myths About X You Still Believe", "The Truth About X" |
