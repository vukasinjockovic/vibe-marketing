# Niche Selection

## Three Criteria for a Great Niche

1. **Wide audience** — millions of potential followers
2. **High RPM** — advertisers pay more per impression
3. **Evergreen** — content stays relevant year-round

## Selection Rule

> "A boring post in a strong niche often pays more than a viral post in a weak niche."

Pick something you can tolerate working on for years. You don't have to love it, but don't pick something you hate.
