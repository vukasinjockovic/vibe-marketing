# Compliance: Staying Monetized

> "Once you're monetized, your #1 priority is staying compliant. Losing monetization is like turning off the money faucet."

## Things That KILL Monetization

| Violation | Why It's Dangerous |
|---|---|
| **Repetitive content** | Same type of video/image repeatedly → flagged as "low-quality" |
| **Plagiarized/Unoriginal content** | Copying from TikTok, YouTube, other pages without transformation |
| **Spammy posts** | Clickbait headlines, excessive emojis, links in every caption, misleading thumbnails |
| **Engagement bait** | Forced "Like this if you agree" or "Tag 3 friends to win!" |
| **Policy violations** | Violence, nudity, misinformation, political disinformation — even in comments |
| **Page inactivity** | Going dark for long periods → lose monetization status |

## Minimum Activity

Post consistently — at minimum 3-4 times per week, even during slow periods.

## Content Transformation Rules

When curating content from elsewhere:
- Always make it your own or add value
- Rewrite captions completely
- Use AI to paraphrase (never copy-paste)
- Use Creative Commons images from Google
- Don't post stolen media — "You never know when someone claims ownership"

## Common Reasons for Rejection/Loss

1. Page has been inactive or inconsistent
2. Doesn't meet Facebook's monetization policies
3. Lots of followers from ineligible countries
4. Violations or copyright issues
5. Spammy or low-effort content
6. Applied too early — page wasn't ready when review came

## The Rule

> "Stay original. Stay clean. Treat your page like a business — because it is. A few shortcuts may look tempting but can cost you everything you've built."
