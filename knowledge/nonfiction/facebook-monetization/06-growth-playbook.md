# Growth Playbook: 0 → 10K+ Followers

**Prerequisite:** Post at least 20 pieces of content before inviting anyone. Don't send people to an empty page.

## Step 1: Organic Foundation

1. **Invite friends & family** to follow and share
2. **Join 5-20 relevant Facebook groups** (active, niche-related, not spam groups) — share page content daily
3. **Use Facebook's Invite Tool** — after each post, invite people who liked/reacted/commented to follow (up to 1,000 invites/day FREE)
4. **Comment on viral posts** in your niche using your PAGE (not personal profile)

## Step 2: Page Like Ad Campaign (The Shortcut)

> "The fastest and best way to grow your page. It'll cost a few hundred bucks, but it's definitely worth it."

### Setup (Meta Ads Manager)

1. Go to adsmanager.facebook.com
2. Create → Engagement → Manual engagement campaign
3. **Budget:** Ad set level (NOT campaign level)
4. **Goal:** Maximize number of Page Likes
5. **Charged by:** Page Likes (if available), otherwise Impressions
6. **Location:** High-RPM country (US preferred)
7. **Audience:** Advantage+ (can't turn off). No interests needed.
8. **Placements:** Manual → Mobile only → Facebook Feed only → turn off everything else
9. **Ad creative:** 1080x1080 image matching your niche
10. **Primary text:** Short, engaging. Examples: "Hit 'Like' to get daily recipes!" / "Follow us for Daily Inspiration!"

- Niche-relevant image in the middle
- 3 words at the bottom + pointing finger graphic

## Step 3: Engagement Ads (Week 4+)

- Edit campaign daily — swap in a new post
- Do this every day for a full week
- Builds engagement momentum that triggers monetization invite

## Step 4: Group Amplification

- Create a public Facebook group linked to your page
- Cross-post viral page content to the group
- Use "Invite Followers to Group" feature (built-in)
- Use @everyone tag occasionally in first comment
- Facebook is pushing group content hard — group posts often trend

> "Once your page grows to 20K-40K followers, you don't need manual growth tactics anymore. Facebook automatically pushes your content to non-followers."
