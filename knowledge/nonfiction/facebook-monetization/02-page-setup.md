# Page Setup Checklist

## 8 Steps to Launch

1. **Create the Page** — facebook.com/pages/create
2. **Page Name** — Clear, keyword-friendly, brandable (e.g., "LifeProTips")
3. **Logo** — Canva, clean/simple, bold fonts, high contrast, circular format, readable at small sizes
4. **Cover Image** — Canva, visually appealing, niche-relevant, professional. Don't overthink it.
5. **Description** — Short, benefit-driven. Example: "Tips that improve your life in one way or another."
6. **Category** — Pick: Personal Blog, Motivational Speaker, or News & Media Website (depends on niche)
7. **CTA Button** — Use "Follow" or "Visit the group" (link to your Facebook group)
8. **Backup Admin** — Add a second profile as admin (family member, second account). Must have clean violation history.

## Key Notes

- Build a Facebook group simultaneously with the page
- Don't waste too much time on logo/cover — you can always change later
- Every admin profile must have zero Facebook violations
