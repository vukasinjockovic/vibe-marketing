# Brunson Expert Secrets: Authority, Story Selling & Perfect Webinar

This skill governs HOW you position the expert/guide, tell persuasive stories, break false beliefs, and structure one-to-many selling presentations. It applies to webinars, VSLs, launch sequences, email campaigns, stage presentations, and any content that moves someone from skepticism to purchase through story and belief rewriting.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**On demand.** Activate when the brief involves any of:
- Webinar scripts, VSLs, or stage presentations
- Launch sequences or product launch funnels
- Authority positioning or expert branding
- Offer creation and value stacking
- Story-driven sales copy (origin stories, case studies, testimonials)
- Movement building, tribe creation, or identity-based marketing
- Breaking objections through narrative (not logic)

Before writing, determine:
1. What is the **New Opportunity** being presented? (Not an improvement -- a replacement.)
2. What is the **Big Domino** -- the one belief that, if accepted, makes all objections irrelevant?
3. What are the **three false beliefs** (vehicle, internal, external) the prospect holds?
4. Where does this content sit in the **value ladder**?

If you cannot determine these, ASK before writing.

---

## 2. Core Framework: The Three Pillars

Expert Secrets is built on three pillars that work together:

| Pillar | Function | Book Section |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Creating Your Movement** | Position yourself as the expert/guide, create a New Opportunity (not improvement), build a future-based cause | Section 1 (Secrets 1-6) |
| **Creating Belief** | Tell Epiphany Bridge stories to break false beliefs and rewrite the stories in prospects' minds | Section 2 (Secrets 7-10) |
| **One-to-Many Selling** | Structure presentations using the Perfect Webinar framework: Big Domino + 3 Secrets + Stack & Closes | Section 3 (Secrets 11-15) |

### 2.1 The Movement Formula

Every mass movement requires three elements:

1. **A Charismatic Leader / Expert / Guide** -- not the hero; you are Yoda, not Luke
2. **A New Opportunity** -- never an improvement offer; always an opportunity switch
3. **A Future-Based Cause** -- identity shift + milestone awards + social mission

> "The Expert Offers Someone a New Opportunity and Then Guides Them to a Result with a Future-Based Cause."
> -- Brunson, Section 1

### 2.2 Hook, Story, Offer

Everything you create has three elements:

- **Hook** -- grabs attention (ads, headlines, subject lines)
- **Story** -- builds perceived value through narrative (the body)
- **Offer** -- what you are selling (the CTA)

> "If something isn't working in your funnel, it's always the hook, the story, or the offer."
> -- Brunson, Secret #7

---

## 3. The Epiphany Bridge (Story Structure)

The Epiphany Bridge is the core story framework. Use it for origin stories, case studies, ad scripts, emails, podcast episodes, webinar content -- any time you tell a story to create belief.

### 3.1 The Five Phases

Every Epiphany Bridge story follows five phases:

**Phase 1 -- The Backstory:**
- What is your backstory that gives us a vested interest?
- What is the DESIRE (external: achievement; internal: transformation)?
- What OLD VEHICLES did you try that failed?

**Phase 2 -- The Journey / Conflict:**
- What was THE CALL that started the journey?
- Who/what is THE VILLAIN fighting against you?
- WHAT happens if you fail? (stakes)

**Phase 3 -- New Opportunity:**
- Who was THE GUIDE who gave you the epiphany?
- What was THE EPIPHANY you experienced?
- What is the NEW OPPORTUNITY you created?

**Phase 4 -- The Framework:**
- What STRATEGY/frameworks did you develop?
- What were YOUR RESULTS?
- What were OTHERS' RESULTS?

**Phase 5 -- Achievement and Transformation:**
- What end result did you ACHIEVE? (external desires)
- How did you TRANSFORM? (internal desires)

### 3.2 The 14 Questions

When time permits, answer all 14 questions:

| Phase | # | Question |
|-------|---|----------|
| Backstory | 1 | What is your BACKSTORY that gives us a vested interest in your journey? |
| Backstory | 2 | What is the DESIRE or result you want? (External) |
| Backstory | 3 | What is the DESIRE or result you want? (Internal) |
| Backstory | 4 | What are the OLD VEHICLES you tried that didn't work? |
| Journey | 5 | What was THE CALL that started the journey? |
| Journey | 6 | Who/what is THE VILLAIN? |
| Journey | 7 | WHAT IF you don't succeed? (stakes) |
| New Opportunity | 8 | Who was THE GUIDE? |
| New Opportunity | 9 | What was THE EPIPHANY? |
| New Opportunity | 10 | What is the NEW OPPORTUNITY? |
| Framework | 11 | What STRATEGY/frameworks did you develop? |
| Framework | 12 | What were YOUR RESULTS? |
| Framework | 13 | What were OTHERS' RESULTS? |
| Achievement | 14 | What did you ACHIEVE and how did you TRANSFORM? |

### 3.3 The 30-Second Version

When time is short (mini-stories, supporting stories, ad scripts), cover only the five phases in 2-5 sentences:

> Backstory: I wanted to make money to support my wife.
> Journey: I started selling potato gun DVDs but got shut down by Google.
> New Opportunity: Mike Filsaime told me about an upsell; I discovered funnels.
> Framework: I built funnel frameworks to grow my companies.
> Achievement: I made a ton of money, and my wife retired so she could be a stay-at-home mom.

### 3.4 Story Telling Rules

- **Oversimplify.** Most presidential speeches are at 5th-8th grade reading level. Drop jargon.
- **Use "kinda like" bridges.** Relate unfamiliar concepts to familiar ones. "A funnel is kinda like a McDonald's drive-through..."
- **Emotion first, logic second.** "We make our purchasing decisions based on emotion, and then we use logic to justify those decisions."
- **Build rapport before story.** Give the hero at least 2 of: victim of outside force, in jeopardy, likable, funny, powerful.
- **Introduce desire early.** Every story moves toward pleasure (win, retrieve) or away from pain (escape, stop).

---

## 4. The Hero's Two Journeys

Every hero has TWO journeys running simultaneously:

| Journey | Type | What It Is | Example |
|---------|------|------------|---------|
| Journey 1 | **Achievement** | External, visible goal | Win the fight, build the business, lose the weight |
| Journey 2 | **Transformation** | Internal, identity change | Become courageous, become a leader, become confident |

**The transformation journey is what actually matters.** Rocky didn't beat Apollo Creed, but he became someone new. Lightning McQueen didn't win the Piston Cup, but he transformed.

When writing stories, always resolve BOTH journeys:
- Achievement = external desires fulfilled
- Transformation = identity shift / internal desires fulfilled

> "The journey of achievement is what drives the story forward, but it's the journey of transformation that matters the most."
> -- Brunson, Secret #8

---

## 5. The Four Core Stories (False Belief Breaking)

### 5.1 How Beliefs Form

Experience -> Story -> Belief

People have experiences, create stories about those experiences, and those stories become beliefs. To change behavior, you must rewrite the story, which rewrites the belief.

> "My goal in my marketing is to rewrite the story that's inside of people's heads."
> -- Craig Clemens, quoted in Secret #10

### 5.2 The Four Stories

Every sales presentation needs four stories, each targeting a different layer of false belief:

| # | Story | Target | False Belief Example | Purpose |
|---|-------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Origin Story** | The New Opportunity | "The old way works fine" | Break belief in current vehicle; show new opportunity |
| 2 | **Vehicle Framework Story** | Vehicle/Framework | "This specific approach won't work" | Break false beliefs about YOUR method |
| 3 | **Internal Beliefs Story** | Self-doubt | "I can't do this" | Break belief they lack ability |
| 4 | **External Beliefs Story** | External blockers | "Something outside me will stop me" | Break belief in external obstacles |

### 5.3 The False Belief Rewriting Process

For each false belief:

1. **Identify the chain of false belief** -- What do they believe that holds them back?
2. **Find the experience** -- What happened that created this belief?
3. **Name the story** -- What story do they tell themselves now?
4. **Create a New Epiphany Bridge** -- What story can you tell that gives them a new epiphany?

### 5.4 Story Inventory

Before writing any sales content, build an inventory:
- List all false beliefs about the new opportunity (vehicle)
- List all false beliefs about their ability (internal)
- List all false beliefs about external forces (external)
- For each, create an Epiphany Bridge story that breaks it

## 6. The Perfect Webinar Framework

### 6.1 Structure Overview

The Perfect Webinar has three phases:

| Phase | Duration (90 min) | Duration (30 min) | Purpose |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Big Domino + Origin Story | 15 min | 5 min | Establish the One Thing; tell origin story |
| The Three Secrets | 45 min (15 each) | 15 min (5 each) | Break three false belief patterns |
| The Stack and Closes | 30 min | 10 min | Present offer, stack value, close |

**The ratios stay the same regardless of total time.** Expand or compress each section proportionally.

### 6.2 The Big Domino (The One Thing)

The entire presentation is designed to get the audience to believe ONE thing:

> "If I can make people believe that [new opportunity] is the key to [desired result] and is only attainable through [my vehicle], then all other objections become irrelevant."
> -- Brunson, Secret #12

**The Big Domino Statement formula:**

```
If I can make them believe that [MY NEW OPPORTUNITY] is the key to
[THEIR DESIRED RESULT] and is only attainable through [MY SPECIFIC VEHICLE],
then all other objections and concerns become irrelevant and they have to give me money.
```

**Critical rule from Perry Belcher:** "If they tried to make more than one point or ask someone to focus on more than one thing in a sales message, conversion rates dropped by half!"

The three secrets are NOT new things to believe. They attack the Big Domino from three different angles.

### 6.3 The Three Secrets (Content Section)

Each Secret follows this structure:

1. **State the Secret** (curiosity-driven title)
2. **Introduce the Framework's Name**
3. **Share the Epiphany Bridge Story** (how you learned/earned it)
4. **Teach the STRATEGY** (the what, NOT the how)
5. **Show Case Studies**
6. **Share Supporting Epiphany Bridge Stories** (break remaining false beliefs)

| Secret | Targets | False Belief Type |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Secret #1 | The Vehicle | "This new opportunity won't work" |
| Secret #2 | Internal Beliefs | "I can't do this / I'm not capable" |
| Secret #3 | External Beliefs | "Something outside me will prevent success" |

**CRITICAL: Teach the WHAT, not the HOW.**

> "When you are selling, you do not teach the tactics. You teach the what (strategy) but not the how. Your audience's desire for the how is the reason they are going to give you money."
> -- Brunson, Secret #11

After each Secret, use Jason Fladlien's technique:
> "You're probably thinking [false belief], right? Well, [quick Epiphany Bridge story]."

This single technique more than doubled sales for multiple Inner Circle members.

### 6.4 The Stack

The Stack is how you present your offer. Taught to Brunson by Armand Morin.

**Core Principle:** "The only thing prospects remember when you sell is the last thing you show them."

**How the Stack works:**
1. Introduce the first element of your offer
2. Tell the story behind how you created it (learned/earned)
3. Show it on a slide with its value
4. Add the next element -- show BOTH on the same slide with cumulative value
5. Repeat until ALL elements are on one slide
6. The LAST thing they see = the complete offer with total value (not just the last bonus)

**Stack Slide Construction:**
- Core product/service + value
- Framework #1 addressing vehicle false belief + value
- Framework #2 addressing internal false belief + value
- Framework #3 addressing external false belief + value
- Bonus tools/resources + value
- Total value = 10x the actual price

> "If the value doesn't reach [10x], consider adding something more valuable to your offer."
> -- Brunson, Secret #14

### 6.5 The 43 Slides

The full Perfect Webinar presentation follows this slide sequence:

**Opening (Slides 1-6):**
1. Title slide
2. Big promise / hook
3. Build rapport (who you are)
4. The One Thing (Big Domino statement)
5. Qualify yourself (results + others' results)
6. Origin Epiphany Bridge story

**Three Secrets (Slides 7-15):**
7. Transition to Three Secrets
8-10. Secret #1 (Vehicle): State -> Framework -> Story -> Strategy -> Case studies -> Supporting stories
11-13. Secret #2 (Internal): Same flow
14-15. Secret #3 (External): Same flow

**The Transition:**
16. "Let me show you everything you're going to get..."

**The Stack (Slides 17-43):**
17-27. Introduce elements one by one, restacking after each
28. Destroy #1 reason people don't get started
29-30. Continue stacking
31. The Big Stack Slide (all elements + total value)
32. "If all" statements (3 rounds tied to 3 secrets)
33. "I had two choices" close
34. "What would the end result be worth?" close
35. Price drop (from value to retail)
36. Price reveal + first CTA
37. Price justification
38. "You've got two choices" close
39. Guarantee
40. "The real question is this..." (no-brainer close)
41. Last Stack Slide recap
42. Urgency/scarcity bonus
43. Closing CTA + Q&A slide

### 6.6 The "If All" Statements

After the Big Stack Slide, use Dave VanHoose's "If all" technique:

```
"Now obviously, I'm not going to charge you $[TOTAL VALUE].
But if I DID charge you $[TOTAL VALUE], and all it did was
[RESULT FROM SECRET #1], would it be worth it?"

[Pause for mental yes]

"And if all it did was [RESULT FROM SECRET #2], would it be worth it?"

[Pause for mental yes]

"And what if all it did was [RESULT FROM SECRET #3], would it be worth it?"

[Pause for mental yes]
```

They have now said yes three times at the 10x price. When you reveal the actual price, it feels like a 90% discount.

---

## 7. Trial Closes and Mini Closes

### 7.1 Trial Closes

Sprinkle yes-or-no questions throughout the entire presentation where the only logical answer is "yes." This creates a "habit of agreement."

> "What I've been doing is a little technique I call trial closes. I've been asking you dozens of little yes-or-no questions where the only answer is yes."
> -- Ted Thomas, quoted in Secret #15

**Examples:**
- "Are you ready to get started?"
- "Are you all getting this?"
- "Is this making sense?"
- "Can you imagine if that happened to you?"
- "Would you like to be our next case study?"
- "Isn't that cool?"
- "Can you see yourself doing [X]?"

**When to use:** After every case study, success story, or key teaching point. Pause, then stack 3-6 trial closes before moving on.

Brunson reports that adding trial closes to an existing automated webinar increased revenue from $9.45 to $16.50 per registrant -- a 75% increase with no other changes.

### 7.2 The 16 Mini Closes

Use these during the Stack and Close section. Pick the ones that fit your offer:

| # | Close Name | Core Argument |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Money is good** | Money is a tool for exchange; you trade it for greater value |
| 2 | **Disposable income** | You already spend disposable income on things that don't serve you |
| 3 | **Money replenishes** | Money comes back every 2 weeks; time does not |
| 4 | **Break old habits** | To get new results, invest in new things |
| 5 | **Information alone** | Knowledge without action is worthless; commitment causes action |
| 6 | **Money or excuses** | You can have money or excuses, not both |
| 7 | **Your two choices** | Do nothing (get nothing) or take a leap of faith |
| 8 | **Their two choices** | I could price it cheap (less value) or premium (more support) |
| 9 | **Us vs them** | We are different from [competitor/old way] because... |
| 10 | **The handhold** | You're not alone; I'll walk you through this step by step |
| 11 | **Say goodbye** | If you don't act, say goodbye to [desired result] |
| 12 | **Now and later** | The cost of waiting is greater than the cost of acting |
| 13 | **Only excuses** | The only thing holding you back now is excuses |
| 14 | **Reluctant hero** | I didn't want to sell this, but people kept asking... |
| 15 | **If you only got** | Even if you only got [smallest benefit], would it be worth it? |
| 16 | **The close close** | Here's the link, here's what to do, go do it now |

---

## 8. Decision Rules

### DR-01: New Opportunity vs Improvement Offer

**IF the offer is positioned as "better/faster/cheaper version of what they're already doing":**
THEN reposition as a New Opportunity. Never sell improvement.

> "Don't try to improve what already exists. CREATE a new opportunity that replaces the old one."
> -- Brunson, Secret #4

Improvement offers fail because:
- They force the prospect to admit the old way failed (status decrease)
- They put you in a red ocean competing on features
- They trigger "I've already tried that" objections

New Opportunities work because:
- They create hope without requiring admission of failure
- They position you as the category king
- They eliminate comparison shopping

### DR-02: Story Before Framework

**IF you are about to teach a framework or share information:**
THEN always tell the story of how you learned or earned it FIRST.

> "Without this preframe, your audience won't value the gold that you are about to give them."
> -- Brunson, Secret #13

### DR-03: Strategy Not Tactics

**IF you are in a selling context (webinar, VSL, sales page):**
THEN teach the WHAT (strategy) but NOT the HOW (tactics).

The desire for "how" is what gets them to buy. Teaching tactics in a sales context:
- Overwhelms the prospect
- Makes them think they can do it without buying
- Reduces perceived need for the product

**IF you are in a teaching context (course, coaching, fulfillment):**
THEN teach both strategy AND tactics. Use the full framework: Story -> Strategy -> Tactics -> Social Proof.

### DR-04: One Big Domino Only

**IF the sales message asks the prospect to believe more than one thing:**
THEN simplify to ONE core belief (the Big Domino).

> "If they tried to make more than one point or ask someone to focus on more than one thing in a sales message, conversion rates dropped by half!"
> -- Perry Belcher, quoted in Secret #12

Everything in the presentation supports this one belief from different angles.

### DR-05: False Belief Identification

**IF you are writing any persuasive content:**
THEN first list the false beliefs the audience holds about:
1. The vehicle/new opportunity (Secret #1)
2. Their own ability to execute (Secret #2)
3. External forces that might stop them (Secret #3)

Then create stories (Epiphany Bridges) that break each one.

### DR-06: Status as Prime Mover

**IF choosing how to position an offer:**
THEN ask: "Will the prospect believe this INCREASES their status?"

> "Every buying decision is based on status: Will this increase or decrease my perceived status?"
> -- Brunson, Secret #4

People buy what elevates their status in their own eyes and in the eyes of those whose opinions they value. Never position an offer that requires the prospect to admit failure or look foolish.

### DR-07: Stack Last, Not Bonuses Last

**IF presenting an offer with bonuses:**
THEN use the Stack format -- add each element cumulatively to one slide so the LAST thing shown is the COMPLETE offer, not the final bonus.

If you show bonuses one-by-one and end on the last bonus, prospects anchor to that bonus's value instead of the full offer's value.

### DR-08: Urgency and Scarcity Are Not Optional

**IF making any offer:**
THEN include genuine urgency and/or scarcity.

> "Do not skip this part! It is the key to getting people to buy immediately. If they leave the webinar, the chances of them coming back and buying later are almost zero."
> -- Brunson, Secret #14

---

## 9. Pre-Writing Checklist

Before writing any Expert Secrets-style content, verify:

- [ ] **New Opportunity defined** -- not improvement, not "better version of old thing"
- [ ] **Big Domino statement written** -- one sentence: "If they believe [X], all objections fall"
- [ ] **Three false beliefs identified** -- vehicle, internal, external
- [ ] **Epiphany Bridge stories prepared** -- one origin story + one per false belief (minimum 4)
- [ ] **Story inventory built** -- supporting stories for additional objections
- [ ] **Framework teaching follows strategy-only rule** (if selling context)
- [ ] **Stack Slide planned** -- all offer elements with values, total = 10x price
- [ ] **Trial closes inserted** -- every 2-3 minutes, especially after case studies
- [ ] **Expert positioned as Guide, not Hero** -- customer is the hero
- [ ] **Future-based cause articulated** -- what movement are they joining?

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns

| ID | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong | Fix |
|----|-------------|-----------------|-----|
| AP-01 | **Teaching tactics in a sales presentation** | Overwhelms; kills sales | Teach strategy (what), not tactics (how) |
| AP-02 | **Selling improvement instead of new opportunity** | Forces admission of past failure; decreases status | Reposition as opportunity switch |
| AP-03 | **Multiple Big Dominos** | Each additional belief point halves conversion | Reduce to ONE core belief |
| AP-04 | **Skipping the origin story** | No rapport, no emotional connection, no trust | Always start with Epiphany Bridge |
| AP-05 | **Logic before emotion** | "Selling on logic is like trying to push a boulder uphill" | Lead with story/emotion; justify with logic after |
| AP-06 | **Presenting framework without learned/earned story** | Audience doesn't value the information | Tell the story of how you discovered it first |
| AP-07 | **Ending on the last bonus** | Prospects anchor value to final bonus, not full offer | Use the Stack -- last slide = complete offer |
| AP-08 | **No trial closes** | First "yes" you ask for is their money | Ask yes-questions every 2-3 minutes throughout |
| AP-09 | **Skipping urgency/scarcity** | People leave "to think about it" and never return | Real deadlines, limited quantities, live-only bonuses |
| AP-10 | **Expert as Hero** | Audience can't relate; feels like bragging | You are the Guide (Yoda); the customer is the Hero (Luke) |
| AP-11 | **Using jargon / being too technical** | Breaks rapport; loses the oversimplification principle | Use "kinda like" bridges; write at 5th-8th grade level |
| AP-12 | **No false belief identification** | Stories have no target; persuasion is unfocused | Map every story to a specific false belief it breaks |
| AP-13 | **Positioning in a red ocean** | Competing on price/features instead of category | Create your own niche/category; become category king |
| AP-14 | **No identity shift in the offer** | Customer doesn't feel part of a movement | Give them a new identity label; make them part of a tribe |
| AP-15 | **Free guests get free content** | Zero commitment = zero action | Getting them to invest (buy) is itself a service |

---

## 11. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### Must-Follow (Violating these will kill results)

1. **One Big Domino per presentation.** Never ask the prospect to believe more than one core thing.
2. **New Opportunity, not improvement.** Every offer must be positioned as an opportunity switch.
3. **Story before information.** Never teach a framework without first telling the story of how you learned/earned it.
4. **Strategy only in selling contexts.** Teach the WHAT, never the HOW, when selling.
5. **The Stack format for all offers.** Cumulative value, last slide = complete offer.
6. **Break false beliefs with stories, not arguments.** Stories rewrite beliefs; logic triggers resistance.
7. **Expert = Guide, not Hero.** Position the customer as the hero of their own journey.

### Should-Follow (Significantly improves results)

8. **Trial closes every 2-3 minutes.** Build the habit of "yes" throughout.
9. **Build the Story Inventory first.** Map all false beliefs before writing any copy.
10. **Use the 5-phase Epiphany Bridge structure.** Even for 30-second stories.
11. **Include urgency and scarcity.** Genuine deadlines and limitations drive action.
12. **Oversimplify everything.** Use "kinda like" bridges. Write at accessible reading levels.
13. **Address all three false belief types.** Vehicle, internal, external -- miss one and sales suffer.
14. **Status check every offer element.** If it decreases perceived status, reposition.

### Nice-to-Have (Polish and optimization)

15. **Use "If all" statements before price reveal.** Gets three mental yeses at 10x value.
16. **Include the "Reluctant Hero" frame.** "I didn't want to sell this, but people kept asking."
17. **Weekly webinar model for testing.** Promote Mon-Thu, Present Thu, Replay Fri-Sun, Close Sun midnight.
18. **5-Minute Perfect Webinar for ads.** Compressed version for lower-priced front-end offers.
19. **Supporting Epiphany Bridge blitz.** "You're probably thinking X, right? Well..." after each Secret.
20. **Prolific Zone positioning.** Be polarizing enough to attract true fans; avoid the mainstream zone and the crazy zone.

---

## 12. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing any Expert Secrets-style content, verify:

1. **Big Domino test:** Can you state the ONE belief the entire piece drives toward in one sentence?
2. **New Opportunity test:** Is this positioned as a replacement, not an improvement? Would the prospect need to admit past failure to accept it?
3. **Story-first test:** Does every framework/teaching point have a story before it?
4. **Strategy-only test (if selling):** Did you teach the WHAT without revealing the HOW?
5. **False belief coverage:** Are all three types addressed (vehicle, internal, external)?
6. **Stack test:** Is the offer presented cumulatively, with the complete offer as the final image?
7. **Trial close audit:** Are there yes-questions at least every 2-3 minutes?
8. **Guide positioning test:** Does the reader feel like the hero, or does the expert feel like the hero?
9. **Status test:** Does every element of the offer feel like a status INCREASE to the prospect?
10. **Urgency test:** Is there a genuine reason to act NOW vs. later?
11. **"Kinda like" test:** Would a non-expert understand every concept? Are there any unexplained jargon terms?
12. **Epiphany Bridge completeness:** Does every story cover all 5 phases (even briefly)?

## 14. The New Opportunity Framework

### 14.1 Three Core Markets

All businesses fit into three core markets:

1. **Health** (physical well-being, fitness, nutrition)
2. **Wealth** (money, business, career, investments)
3. **Relationships** (love, family, social connections)

Each market has submarkets, and each submarket has niches. Your job: find your niche and become the **Category King**.

> "Category kings take 70-80% of profits in their category."
> -- From "Play Bigger," cited in Secret #3

### 14.2 Opportunity Switch vs Opportunity Stack

- **Opportunity Switch:** Replacing the prospect's current vehicle with a completely new one (front of value ladder)
- **Opportunity Stack:** Adding more tools/methods within the same opportunity (up the value ladder)

Use ONE opportunity switch at the front. Then stack variations of the same opportunity as they ascend.
