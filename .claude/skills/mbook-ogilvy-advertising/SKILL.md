# Ogilvy Advertising Craft

This skill governs HOW you write advertising copy. It encodes the specific, research-backed rules David Ogilvy distilled from decades of practice -- every percentage, every formula, every anti-pattern. When this skill is active, every headline, body copy block, layout decision, and creative choice must pass through these rules.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**On demand.** Activate when writing:
- Print advertisements (magazine, newspaper, digital display)
- Long-form sales copy or advertorials
- Direct response copy (letters, landing pages, email sequences)
- Brand advertising (image-building campaigns)
- Headlines for any marketing content
- TV/video commercial scripts

Before writing, complete the Pre-Writing Checklist (Section 8). No exceptions.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy

Ogilvy's advertising is built on five foundational truths:

**Truth 1: Advertising is salesmanship in print.**
> "I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information."

Every word must sell. If it entertains without selling, cut it. "When Aeschines spoke, they said, 'How well he speaks.' But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, 'Let us march against Philip.'"

**Truth 2: Research before writing.**
> "Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."

Study the product exhaustively. Study competitors. Research consumers -- their language, desires, concerns. Then write.

**Truth 3: The consumer is not a moron.**
> "The consumer is not a moron, she is your wife."

Write with respect. Use facts, not puffery. Include specifics, not generalities. Never talk down.

**Truth 4: Brand image is everything.**
> "Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the brand image."

Products have personalities. Consumers "taste images." The brand image is 90% of what many companies have to sell.

**Truth 5: Big Ideas run for decades.**
> "Unless your advertising contains a big idea, it will pass like a ship in the night."

You are advertising to a moving parade, not a standing army. A good ad can run for 30 years.

---

## 3. The Big Idea

Before writing, determine whether you have a Big Idea. Test it against Ogilvy's five questions:

1. Did it make me gasp when I first saw it?
2. Do I wish I had thought of it myself?
3. Is it unique?
4. Does it fit the strategy to perfection?
5. Could it be used for 30 years?

If you cannot answer YES to all five, you do not have a Big Idea. Keep searching.

> "I doubt if more than one campaign in a hundred contains a big idea."

Process for finding Big Ideas:
1. Stuff your conscious mind with information (homework phase)
2. Unhook your rational thought process
3. Wait for the unconscious to deliver

> "Big ideas come from the unconscious. This is true in art, in science and in advertising. But your unconscious has to be well informed, or your idea will be irrelevant."

---

## 4. Headline Rules

The headline is the most important element. Five times as many people read headlines as read body copy. If the headline does not sell, you have wasted 90% of your money.

### 4.1 Headline Decision Rules

**DR-01: Always promise a benefit.**
Headlines that promise a benefit are read by 4x more people than headlines that don't.
> "Advertising which promises no benefit to the consumer does not sell, yet the majority of campaigns contain no promise whatever. (That is the most important sentence in this book.)"

**DR-02: Include news when available.**
Ads with news in headlines are recalled by 22% more people than ads without news.
> "Don't scorn tried-and-true words like amazing, introducing, now, suddenly."

**DR-03: Include the brand name.**
If you don't include the brand name, 80% of readers (who skip body copy) will never know what product you are advertising.

**DR-04: Flag your target audience.**
IF your product serves a niche group THEN put a flagging word in the headline (e.g., asthma, bedwetters, women over thirty-five).

**DR-05: Use quotation marks.**
Headlines in quotes increase recall by 28%.

**DR-06: Prefer specifics over generalities.**
> "When research reported that the average shopper thought Sears Roebuck made a profit of 37 per cent on sales, I headlined an advertisement Sears makes a profit of 5 per cent."

**DR-07: Long headlines can work.**
A study of retail ads found headlines of ten words sell more merchandise than short headlines. Do not fear length if needed to convey the promise.

**DR-08: Localize for local media.**
IF advertising in local newspapers THEN include the city name in the headline. People are most interested in what happens where they live.

### 4.2 Headline Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Blind headlines** | Don't say what the product is or does. 20% below average in recall. |
| **No headline at all** | "The silliest thing of all." Five times more people read headlines than body copy. |
| **Puns, double meanings, obscurities** | "Counter-productive. In the average newspaper your headline has to compete with 350 others." |
| **Period at end of headline** | "Periods are also called full stops, because they stop the reader dead in his tracks." |
| **ALL CAPITALS** | "Capitals retard reading. They have no ascenders or descenders to help you recognize words." |

---

## 5. Body Copy Rules

### 5.1 Opening

**DR-09: Grabber first paragraph.**
IF writing long copy THEN your first paragraph must be a grabber. Limit the opening paragraph to a maximum of 11 words.

**DR-10: Use a drop-initial.**
IF starting body copy THEN use a drop-initial capital letter. Increases readership by 13%.

### 5.2 Tone and Style

**DR-11: Write as one human to another.**
> "Do not address your readers as though they were gathered together in a stadium. When people read your copy, they are alone. Pretend you are writing each of them a letter."

**DR-12: Never bore the reader.**
> "You cannot bore people into buying your product. You can only interest them in buying it."

**DR-13: Use simple words.**
> "It pays to write short sentences and short paragraphs, and to avoid difficult words."

Ogilvy once wrote that Dove made soap "obsolete," then discovered the majority of housewives did not know what the word meant.

**DR-14: Write in story form when possible.**
> "'They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano -- But When I Started to Play...'"

Stories engage. Facts in story form are retained better than facts alone.

### 5.3 Content Rules

**DR-15: Long copy outsells short copy.**
> "Direct-response advertisers know that short copy doesn't sell. In split-run tests, long copy invariably outsells short copy."
> "The more facts you tell, the more you sell."

Ogilvy believes long copy conveys the impression you have something important to say, whether people read it or not.

**DR-16: Use testimonials -- but the right kind.**
Testimonials from fellow consumers are more persuasive than anonymous puffery. Testimonials from relevant experts can be powerful ("an ex-burglar testifying he could never crack a Chubb safe"). BUT: celebrity testimonials are below average in changing brand preference -- viewers remember the celebrity and forget the product.

**DR-17: Include the price.**
> "When the price of the product is left out, people have a way of turning the page."

**DR-18: Avoid analogies.**
> "Gallup has found that they are widely misunderstood. If you are writing copy for a face cream and say, 'Just as plants require moisture, so too does your skin,' readers don't complete the equation."

**DR-19: Avoid superlatives.**
> "Stay away from superlatives like 'Our product is the best in the world.' Gallup calls this Brag and Boast. It convinces nobody."

### 5.4 Structure Rules

**DR-20: Cross-heads every 2-3 inches.**
> "Cross-heads keep the reader marching forward. Make some of them interrogative, to excite curiosity in the next run of copy."

**DR-21: Leading between paragraphs.**
Line-spacing between paragraphs increases readership by 12%.

**DR-22: Bold/italic for key paragraphs.**
Use emphasis sparingly to highlight critical claims or testimonials.

**DR-23: Numbered lists for unrelated facts.**
When presenting multiple factual points, use numbered lists (as in the Rolls-Royce 13-point format).

---

## 6. Visual and Layout Rules

### 6.1 Layout Order

**DR-24: Illustration at top, headline below, copy below headline.**
Readers look first at illustration, then headline, then copy. Headlines below the illustration are read by 10% more people than headlines above.

### 6.2 Editorial Format

**DR-25: Make it look editorial, not like an ad.**
> "Roughly six times as many people read the average article as the average advertisement."

Template:
- Serif type (not sans-serif)
- Three columns, 35-45 characters wide
- Caption on every image (with brand name and promise)
- Drop-initials to start copy
- Black type on white background
- No reverse type (white on black)

### 6.3 Illustration Rules

**DR-26: Use photographs, not drawings.**
> "Photographs attracted more readers, were more believable, and better remembered."
> "Direct-response advertisers find that photographs pull more coupons than drawings."

**DR-27: Maximize story appeal.**
Use photographs that arouse curiosity -- "What goes on here?" The more story appeal, the more people look at your ad.

**DR-28: Show before-and-after when possible.**
> "Gallup did not find a single before-and-after campaign that did not increase sales."

**DR-29: Use four-color.**
Four-color ads cost 50% more than black-and-white but are 100% more memorable. A good bargain.

**DR-30: Keep illustrations simple.**
Focus on one person. Avoid crowd scenes. Don't enlarge faces bigger than life size.

**DR-31: Always caption illustrations.**
> "More people read the captions under illustrations than read the body copy."

Every caption must include the brand name and the promise.

### 6.4 Typography Anti-Patterns

| Never Do This | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| Reverse type (white on black) | "Almost impossible to read." One charity raised twice as much with black on white. |
| ALL CAPS in headlines | "Capitals retard reading. They tend to be read letter by letter." |
| Sans-serif for body copy | Serif type is more readable for long text. |
| Type smaller than 11-point | Readership drops. "This is 11-point, and about right." |
| Period at end of headlines | Full stops stop the reader dead. |

---

## 7. Direct Response Principles

Ogilvy considers direct response "my first love and secret weapon" because it forces accountability. Every technique is tested and measured.

### 7.1 Key Direct Response Rules

**DR-32: Long copy invariably outsells short copy in split-run tests.**

**DR-33: Direct response TV must be at least 2 minutes.**
30 seconds is insufficient. Structure: set up problem, demonstrate solution, money-back guarantee, price, ask for the order explicitly and urgently, promise multiple benefits, allow 20 seconds for ordering information, repeat toll-free number at least twice.

**DR-34: Best times and months.**
Best times: early morning, late evening, weekends. Best months: January, February, March.

### 7.2 Direct Mail Testing Hierarchy

Test in this priority order:
1. Positioning of product
2. Pricing
3. Terms of payment
4. Premiums
5. Format of mailing

Test one variable at a time. Treat the winner as "control" and continuously test ways to beat it.

---

## 8. Pre-Writing Checklist

Complete ALL steps before writing a single word.

**Step 1 -- Study the Product:**
- [ ] Read everything available about the product (plan for days, not hours)
- [ ] Identify the key factual claims (specific numbers, test results, ingredients)
- [ ] Note the product's "inherent drama" -- the most interesting factual detail

**Step 2 -- Study the Competition:**
- [ ] What advertising are competitors running?
- [ ] What has worked for them? What has not?
- [ ] What promises are they making?

**Step 3 -- Research the Consumer:**
- [ ] What language do consumers use when discussing this product category?
- [ ] What attributes matter most to them?
- [ ] What promise would be most likely to make them buy?

**Step 4 -- Decide Positioning:**
- [ ] What does the product do? (Function)
- [ ] Who is it for? (Target)
- [ ] Complete the sentence: "[Product] is a [category] for [target] who [need/desire]."

**Step 5 -- Decide Brand Image:**
- [ ] What personality should this brand have?
- [ ] Is the image consistent with all previous advertising?
- [ ] Does the image project quality -- "a First Class ticket"?

**Step 6 -- Search for the Big Idea:**
- [ ] Does it pass all five questions? (gasp, wish, unique, fits strategy, 30 years)
- [ ] Is the product the hero?
- [ ] Is there a factual detail that can anchor the campaign (like the electric clock)?

## 10. Anti-Patterns

These are FAILURE MODES. Violate any and the advertising dies.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| AP-01 | **Creativity without sales** | "If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative." Of 81 Clio winners, 36 agencies lost the account or went bankrupt. |
| AP-02 | **Irrelevant sex** | Ogilvy's first ad showed a naked woman -- for a cooking stove. It failed because it was irrelevant. |
| AP-03 | **Committee-designed campaigns** | "Search the parks in all your cities / You'll find no statues of committees." |
| AP-04 | **Intuition over knowledge** | "Will you choose a surgeon who has read some books on anatomy, or one who relies on his intuition?" |
| AP-05 | **Reverse type** | 49 ads in one magazine issue used reverse despite decades of research showing it kills readability. |
| AP-06 | **Celebrity testimonials** | Viewers remember the celebrity and forget the product. Below average in brand preference change. |
| AP-07 | **Cartoons for adults** | "Below average in selling to grown-ups." |
| AP-08 | **Musical vignettes** | "Entertaining, perhaps, but impotent if you want to sell." |
| AP-09 | **Naming competitors** | Less believable and more confusing than ads that don't. |
| AP-10 | **Too many scene changes** | Below average in changing brand preference. |
| AP-11 | **Changing good ads too soon** | "Scores of good advertisements have been discarded before they lost their potency." |
| AP-12 | **Promotions over advertising** | "The short-sighted opportunist who siphons off his advertising dollars for short-term promotions." |
| AP-13 | **Fatuous corporate slogans** | "All these bromides are interchangeable -- any company could use any of them." |
| AP-14 | **Artdirectoritis** | Speaking of "cool grey bands of type" as if copy were a mere design element. Cure: KISS. |
| AP-15 | **Ignoring captions** | 4x as many people read captions as body copy -- yet most art directors don't write them. |
| AP-16 | **Too many objectives** | "By attempting to cover too many things, they achieve nothing." |
| AP-17 | **Jingles without clarity** | "If you went into a store and asked a salesman to show you a refrigerator, how would you react if he started singing at you?" |

---

## 11. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Every headline must promise a benefit.** This is Ogilvy's single most important rule. Headlines that promise benefits are read by 4x more people.

2. **Do your homework first.** Study the product for days, not hours. The Rolls-Royce headline came from three weeks of reading.

3. **Make the product the hero.** "There are no dull products, only dull writers."

4. **Use specific facts, never vague claims.** "Sears makes a profit of 5 per cent" beats "Sears is a great company."

5. **Include the brand name in the headline.** 80% of readers never read body copy.

6. **Write conversationally.** One human being writing to another. Second person. Simple words.

7. **Never use reverse type.** Research proves it kills readability. No exceptions.

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

8. **Use long copy for direct response and high-consideration products.** "Long copy invariably outsells short copy."

9. **Use editorial layout format.** Serif type, three columns, captions on images, black on white.

10. **Include news when you have it.** 22% more recall for news headlines.

11. **Use photographs, not drawings.** More readers, more credible, better remembered.

12. **Caption every illustration.** More people read captions than body copy.

13. **Repeat winners until they stop selling.** Readership doesn't decline through at least four repetitions.

### NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable)

14. **Use quotation marks on headlines** for 28% more recall.

15. **Use drop-initials** at the start of body copy for 13% more readership.

16. **Add leading between paragraphs** for 12% more readership.

17. **Flag your target audience** in headlines for niche products.

18. **Include the price** to prevent page-turning.

---

## 12. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify ALL of these:

1. **Benefit Check:** Does the headline promise a specific benefit? Not an abstraction -- a concrete result the reader wants?

2. **Brand Name Check:** Is the brand name in the headline? If 80% won't read body copy, will they know what you're advertising?

3. **Specificity Check:** Can you replace any generality with a specific fact? "5 per cent profit" beats "reasonable profit." "607 words of factual copy" beats "detailed copy."

4. **Homework Test:** Is there a factual detail in this ad that could only come from deep product research? If not, you haven't done enough homework.

5. **Conversational Test:** Read the copy aloud. Does it sound like one person talking to another? Or like a committee memo?

6. **Hero Test:** Is the product the hero? Or has the creative idea overshadowed what you're selling?

7. **Brand Image Test:** Is this ad consistent with the long-term brand image? Would it contribute positively if run for 30 years?

8. **Reverse Type Check:** Is any text set white-on-black? If yes, change it immediately.

9. **Caption Check:** Does every illustration have a caption with the brand name and promise?

10. **Boredom Check:** Would you read this ad yourself? If not, rewrite it. "You cannot bore people into buying your product."

11. **Celebrity Check:** If using a testimonial, is it from a real user or relevant expert? NOT a celebrity (viewers remember the celebrity, forget the product).

12. **Superlative Check:** Does the copy contain any "best in the world" or "number one" claims? Cut them. "Brag and Boast convinces nobody."

13. **Simplicity Check:** Are there any words the average reader might not understand? Ogilvy's "obsolete" mistake with Dove is the cautionary tale.

14. **Longevity Check:** Could this ad run for years without becoming dated? If it relies on a fad, it will die with the fad.

---

## 13. Ogilvy's Factual Long-Copy Formula

The Rolls-Royce format that Ogilvy used for cars, margarine, gasoline, banks, and foreign travel:

**Structure:**
1. Specific factual headline (discovered through homework)
2. Subhead expanding the promise
3. 400-700 words of factual copy
4. Numbered factual points (13 in the Rolls-Royce original)
5. Price
6. Call to action (coupon, address, phone number)

**Typography:**
- Subhead of two lines between headline and body
- Drop-initial to start body (+13% readership)
- Opening paragraph max 11 words
- Cross-heads every 2-3 inches (some interrogative)
- Short "widow" lines at paragraph ends
- Bold/italic for key paragraphs
- Arrowheads, bullets, or asterisks for emphasis
- 11-point serif type
- Leading between paragraphs (+12% readership)

**Why it works:**
> "I believe, without any research to support me, that advertisements with long copy convey the impression that you have something important to say, whether people read the copy or not."

---

## 14. The Parity Product Formula

When your product is no different from competitors:

> "Just say what's good about your product -- and do a clearer, more honest, more informative job of saying it."

Do NOT try to claim superiority. Instead, create confidence that your product is "positively good." Sales will swing to the marketer who creates the most confidence -- not the one who makes the biggest claim.

---

## 16. Key Quotes

Use these for calibration. They encode the foundational principles.

> "I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information."

> "On the average, five times as many people read the headlines as read the body copy. It follows that unless your headline sells your product, you have wasted 90 per cent of your money."

> "Advertising which promises no benefit to the consumer does not sell, yet the majority of campaigns contain no promise whatever. (That is the most important sentence in this book. Read it again.)"

> "The consumer is not a moron, she is your wife."

> "You cannot bore people into buying your product. You can only interest them in buying it."

> "Whenever you can, make the product itself the hero of your advertising. If you think the product too dull, I have news for you: there are no dull products, only dull writers."

> "You aren't advertising to a standing army; you are advertising to a moving parade."

> "Products, like people, have personalities, and they can make or break them in the market place."

> "If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative."

> "If you are too lazy to do this kind of homework, you may occasionally luck into a successful campaign, but you will run the risk of skidding about on what my brother Francis called 'the slippery surface of irrelevant brilliance.'"

> "Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."

> "The more facts you tell, the more you sell."

> "Search the parks in all your cities / You'll find no statues of committees."
