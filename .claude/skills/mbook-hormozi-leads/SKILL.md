# Hormozi Lead Generation

This skill governs HOW you generate leads, write outreach scripts, create ad copy, design lead magnets, and build content strategies. It is on-demand -- activated when the campaign involves getting more people interested in a product or service. Before writing any lead generation copy, you must identify the correct Core Four method, then apply the appropriate framework for that method.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**On-demand.** Selected when the campaign involves lead generation -- outreach scripts (warm or cold), paid ad copy, free content strategy, lead magnet design, referral programs, affiliate recruitment, or any asset where the goal is to turn strangers or contacts into engaged leads.

Before writing any lead generation copy:
1. Determine the audience: WARM (they know you) or COLD (strangers).
2. Determine the delivery: 1-TO-1 (personal) or 1-TO-MANY (broadcast).
3. This gives you the Core Four method (Section 2.1). Use the correct framework for that method.
4. If a lead magnet is involved, design it first (Section 5) before writing any copy.
5. Complete the Pre-Writing Checklist (Section 4) before drafting a single sentence.
6. If the brief lacks enough information to complete the checklist, ASK before writing.

---

## 2. Core Framework

### 2.1 The Core Four

This is the master taxonomy. Every advertising activity in history is a variation of one of these four methods.

```
                    Warm (know you)     Cold (strangers)
1-to-1:            Warm Outreach        Cold Outreach
1-to-many:         Post Free Content    Run Paid Ads
```

> "There have only ever been four ways to let other people know about the stuff you sell."

**Method selection is non-negotiable.** Each method has its own structure, tone, and rules. Do not mix warm outreach language in paid ads or cold outreach scripts in content posts.

### 2.2 The Value Equation (from $100M Offers)

This equation underpins all lead magnet design, ad copy, and value communication.

```
                Dream Outcome  x  Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
Value = -----------------------------------------------------------------------
              Perceived Time Delay  x  Perceived Effort & Sacrifice
```

**TOP (increase these):**
- **(+) Dream Outcome** -- The destination, not the vehicle
- **(+) Perceived Likelihood** -- How certain they feel THIS will work for THEM

**BOTTOM (decrease these):**
- **(-) Time Delay** -- How long until they see results
- **(-) Effort & Sacrifice** -- How hard it is, what they give up

### 2.3 The Goodwill Formula

Drives all organic growth -- referrals, word-of-mouth, affiliate willingness.

```
Goodwill = Value Delivered - Price Charged
```

> "If you make more value than you charge, people tell their friends."

No referral program, affiliate incentive, or growth hack overcomes low goodwill.

## 3. Decision Rules

### Core Four Method Selection

**DR-01: Warm Outreach.**
IF the audience knows you AND you want personalized contact THEN use Warm Outreach. Structure: ACA Framework (Acknowledge, Compliment, Ask). Ask the indirect referral question: "Do you know anyone who [desires outcome]?"

**DR-02: Post Free Content.**
IF the audience knows you AND you want to reach many at once THEN Post Free Content. Structure: Hook-Retain-Reward. Maintain minimum 3:1 give:ask ratio.

**DR-03: Cold Outreach.**
IF reaching strangers AND you want personalized contact THEN use Cold Outreach. Personalize every message. Lead with Big Fast Value. Never pitch first.

**DR-04: Run Paid Ads.**
IF reaching strangers AND you want to reach many at once THEN Run Paid Ads. Structure: Callout + Value + CTA. Use What-Who-When for angle generation.

### Volume and Scaling Rules

**DR-05: Rule of 100.**
IF starting any Core Four method THEN commit to 100 primary actions per day for 100 days before evaluating results. Outreach = 100 contacts/day. Content = 100 minutes/day. Ads = $100/day.

**DR-06: Volume Before Strategy.**
IF advertising is not working THEN check volume first. Most people do 1/100th of required volume and blame the method. 100 per day, not 100 over time.

**DR-07: More Better New Sequence.**
IF you want more leads THEN follow this exact order: (1) Do MORE of what already works, (2) Make it BETTER by finding constraints and testing, (3) Only then try something NEW. Never skip to "new" before maximizing "more" and "better."

**DR-08: Constraint First.**
IF improving an advertising method THEN find the constraint (step with biggest drop-off) and fix ONLY that. Fixing non-constraints does not improve total output.

**DR-09: One Test Per Week.**
IF testing improvements THEN change only one variable per week per platform. Multiple simultaneous changes = unattributable results.

**DR-10: Platform Mastery Before Expansion.**
IF scaling advertising THEN master one platform first, expand to new audiences on it, use all placements and media types on it, THEN add a new platform.

### Lead Magnet Rules

**DR-11: Problem Selection.**
IF creating a lead magnet THEN pick a problem that is (a) meaningful enough to care about and (b) narrow enough to solve completely. If too broad, it cannot deliver. If too narrow, nobody cares.

**DR-12: Lead Magnet Type.**
IF audience does not know they have a problem THEN use Reveal (diagnose/assess). IF audience wants proof your solution works THEN use Sample/Trial. IF audience knows the solution but needs help starting THEN use One Step of a Multi-Step Process.

**DR-13: Quality Standard.**
IF creating a lead magnet THEN make it so good they feel guilty not paying. Give away the secrets, sell the implementation.

**DR-14: Delivery Vehicle.**
IF choosing lead magnet format THEN select from: Software (best scalability), Information (low cost), Services (highest perceived value), Physical Products (high perceived value). Prioritize low-cost, high-perceived-value vehicles.

### Content Strategy Rules

**DR-15: Give:Ask Ratio.**
IF posting free content THEN maintain minimum 3:1 give-to-ask ratio. Ideal: give until they ask. Every ask burns goodwill that must be rebuilt with gives.

**DR-16: Content Unit Structure.**
IF creating any content THEN structure as: Hook (grab attention) + Retain (keep attention) + Reward (deliver value). If the hook fails, nothing else matters.

**DR-17: Hook Components.**
IF writing a hook or headline THEN include one or more of: Recency, Relevancy, Celebrity, Proximity, Conflict, Unusual, Ongoing. A headline with none of these fails to grab attention.

**DR-18: Retention Structure.**
IF structuring content body THEN use one of: Lists (progress markers), Steps (sequential anticipation), Stories (emotional investment).

### Outreach Rules

**DR-19: ACA for Warm.**
IF initiating warm outreach THEN use ACA: Acknowledge (their recent post/event), Compliment (genuine, specific), Ask ("Do you know anyone who...?"). Skipping steps makes the ask feel transactional.

**DR-20: Indirect Referral Ask.**
IF reaching out to warm contacts THEN ask "Do you know anyone who [desires outcome]?" not "Would you be interested in...?" The indirect frame protects the relationship and often produces a self-referral.

**DR-21: Nine-Word Re-Engagement.**
IF re-engaging dormant leads THEN use Dean Jackson's format. Subject: "[First name]?" Body: "Are you still looking to [4-word desire]?" Shorter is better.

**DR-22: Personalize Cold.**
IF doing cold outreach THEN personalize every message with their name, something specific about them, and a clear signal this is not mass-blasted. Generic cold outreach gets zero response.

**DR-23: Value Before Pitch (Cold).**
IF doing cold outreach THEN lead with Big Fast Value. Provide something valuable for free before asking for anything. Pitching first gets ignored.

### Paid Ad Rules

**DR-24: Ad Structure.**
IF writing a paid ad THEN structure as: Callout (who is this for) + Value (what they get) + CTA (what to do next). Every ad needs all three.

**DR-25: Callout Methods.**
IF calling out audience verbally THEN use: Labels ("Attention [avatar]!"), Yes-Questions ("Do you [pain/desire]?"), or If-Then ("If you [situation], then [promise]"). IF calling out visually THEN use: Contrast, Likeness, or Scene.

**DR-26: What-Who-When Angles.**
IF writing the value section of an ad THEN use What-Who-When: WHAT (8 value elements) x WHO (9 perspectives) x WHEN (3 timelines) = up to 216 unique angles per offer. Never run out of creative.

**DR-27: CTA Completeness.**
IF writing a CTA THEN include (a) the specific action to take AND (b) reasons to act now. A CTA without reasons to act now gets delayed and forgotten.

**DR-28: Three Money Phases.**
IF starting paid ads THEN expect: Phase 1 (Track Money -- learn, measure), Phase 2 (Lose Money -- test at scale, expect losses), Phase 3 (Print Money -- scale winners). Quitting during Phase 2 means never reaching Phase 3.

**DR-29: Client Financed Acquisition.**
IF structuring paid ad economics THEN aim for revenue from new customers within 30 days to cover acquisition cost. Self-financing acquisition = unlimited growth potential.

**DR-30: LTGP:CAC Ratio.**
IF evaluating ad profitability THEN maintain minimum 3:1 ratio of Lifetime Gross Profit to Customer Acquisition Cost. Below 3:1 = unprofitable channel or broken offer.

### Lead Getter Rules

**DR-31: Referral Prerequisite.**
IF you want customer referrals THEN first ensure product creates maximum goodwill (Value delivered >> Price charged). No referral program overcomes low goodwill. Fix the product first.

**DR-32: Seven Referral Methods.**
IF asking for referrals THEN select from: (1) One-sided reward, (2) Two-sided reward, (3) Ask at purchase moment, (4) Negotiation chip, (5) Referral events, (6) Ongoing programs, (7) Unlockable bonuses.

**DR-33: Six Organic Referral Drivers.**
IF you want referrals without asking THEN maximize goodwill through: (1) Sell better customers, (2) Set better expectations, (3) Improve success rate, (4) Deliver faster wins, (5) Keep improving product, (6) Tell them what to buy next.

**DR-34: Employee Training (3Ds).**
IF training employees to advertise THEN use: Document (create checklist), Demonstrate (do it in front of them), Duplicate (they do it in front of you). Skipping any step creates failure.

**DR-35: Agency as Learning.**
IF hiring an agency THEN treat as a 6-month learning arrangement, not permanent outsourcing. Learn the skill, then transition in-house. Permanent outsourcing = permanent dependency.

**DR-36: Affiliate Launch.**
IF launching an affiliate program THEN follow: (1) Find ideal affiliates, (2) Make them an offer, (3) Qualify them, (4) Set pay structure, (5) Launch with Whisper-Tease-Shout, (6) Integrate.

**DR-37: Whisper-Tease-Shout.**
IF launching anything (affiliate program, product, offer) THEN sequence: Whisper (curiosity, behind-scenes), Tease (reveal value, share proof), Shout (full CTA + urgency/scarcity).

### Scaling Roadmap Rules

**DR-38: Scaling Levels.**
IF scaling from zero THEN follow in order: Level 1 (warm outreach -- friends know your stuff), Level 2 (warm + content -- consistent personal advertising), Level 3 (hire employees to help), Level 4 (product good enough for 25%+ referrals), Level 5 (multiple methods, multiple platforms), Level 6 (executive-led departments per channel).

**DR-39: Testing Budget.**
IF running paid ads THEN set aside 1-10% of budget for testing new ideas without expecting a return. Consider it an investment in education.

**DR-40: Patience Timeline.**
IF evaluating a new lead source THEN expect 3-6 months to crack it. If your expectations are faster than that, your expectations are unreasonable.

Complete ALL before writing a single word of lead generation copy.

### Audience Identification
- [ ] Target avatar defined (specific person, not broad category)
- [ ] Audience is WARM or COLD (determines entire approach)
- [ ] Delivery is 1-TO-1 or 1-TO-MANY (determines format)

## 5. Lead Magnet Construction

Follow these seven steps in order when designing a lead magnet.

### Step 1: Pick the Right Problem

Choose a problem that is (a) meaningful enough that people care and (b) narrow enough to solve completely within the lead magnet.

> "Narrow your problem. Then narrow it again."

### Step 2: Pick the Solution Type

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Reveal** | Audience doesn't know they have the problem | Assessment, audit, quiz, diagnostic |
| **Sample/Trial** | Audience wants proof it works | Free session, demo, trial period |
| **One Step** | Audience knows the solution, needs help starting | First step of multi-step process free |

### Step 3: Pick the Delivery Vehicle

| Vehicle | Scalability | Perceived Value | Cost |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|------|
| Software | Highest | High | One-time creation |
| Information | High | Moderate | Low |
| Services | Low | Highest | High per delivery |
| Physical | Moderate | High | Per-unit cost |

### Step 4: Name and Test

Use compelling naming: [Dream Outcome] + [Specific Result] + [Timeframe] + [Who It's For].

Generate 5-10 name variants. Test 2-3 best performers.

### Step 5: Make It Easy to Consume

Lower effort = higher completion = higher conversion. Short, actionable, immediately useful.

### Step 6: Make It Exceptional

> "Give away the secrets, sell the implementation."

The lead magnet should be so valuable that people feel guilty for not paying. The knowledge is free. The convenience, speed, and done-for-you implementation is what they pay for.

### Step 7: CTA with Reasons

Tell them exactly what to do next AND give them compelling reasons to do it now.

## 6. Core Four Method Frameworks

### 6.1 Warm Outreach (ACA Framework)

**Structure: Acknowledge -> Compliment -> Ask**

```
ACKNOWLEDGE: Reference their last post, message, or life event
COMPLIMENT:  Genuine, specific praise about something real
ASK:         "Do you know anyone who [desires specific outcome]?"
```

**Full Script Template:**
```
"Hey [Name], [acknowledge their recent post/event].
[Genuine compliment about something specific].
I'm doing something kind of cool -- do you know anyone who would be
interested in [free/discounted service that solves specific problem]?"
```

**If they express interest, pivot to value pitch:**
```
"Cool! So what I'm doing is [dream outcome] for [specific avatar].
The way it works is [brief mechanism].
The best part is [address time delay and effort].
And if [risk reversal / guarantee].
Would you like to [specific next step]?"
```

**Re-engagement (9-Word Email):**
```
Subject: [First name]?
Body: Are you still looking to [4-word desire]?
```

### 6.2 Free Content (Hook-Retain-Reward)

**Structure: Hook -> Retain -> Reward**

**Hook (7 components):**

| Component | What It Does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Recency | Leverages what's new/timely | "Just discovered..." |
| Relevancy | Connects to their current situation | "If you're struggling with [X]..." |
| Celebrity | References notable person/entity | "[Celebrity] uses this..." |
| Proximity | Leverages locality/closeness | "[City] business owners..." |
| Conflict | Creates tension/controversy | "Why most [X] advice is wrong" |
| Unusual | Surprises or subverts expectations | "I fired my best-paying client" |
| Ongoing | Leverages developing situations | "Update on the [X] experiment..." |

**Retain (3 structures):**

| Structure | How It Works | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Lists | Numbered/bulleted progress markers | Quick consumption |
| Steps | Sequential "what's next?" anticipation | How-to content |
| Stories | Narrative with emotional investment | Engagement, shares |

**Reward:** Maximize value per second of consumption. Audience returns when reward > time invested.

**Give:Ask Ratio:**
```
Minimum: 3 give : 1 ask
Better:  5:1 or higher
Ideal:   "Give until they ask"
```

### 6.3 Cold Outreach

**Two Keys:** Personalization + Big Fast Value

**Personalization requirements:**
- Use their name
- Reference something specific about them (company, recent post, achievement)
- Make it unmistakably not a mass blast

**Big Fast Value:**
- Provide something genuinely valuable before asking for anything
- Free audit, free resource, free insight specific to their business
- The value must be delivered FAST (not "schedule a call in 2 weeks")

**Volume requirement:** 100 outreaches per day minimum. Below this, you lack data to evaluate.

### 6.4 Paid Ads (Callout-Value-CTA)

**Structure: Callout -> Value -> CTA**

**Callout Types:**

Verbal:
```
Label:            "Attention [avatar]!"
Yes-Question:     "Do you [pain/desire]?"
If-Then:          "If you [situation], then [promise]."
Ridiculous Result: "[Extreme result] + here's how"
```

Visual:
```
Contrast: Element that stands out from surroundings
Likeness: Image that looks like the target audience
Scene:    Image depicting the desired outcome
```

**Value (What-Who-When Framework):**
```
WHAT: 8 value elements
  (+) Dream Outcome           (-) Nightmare Outcome
  (+) Perceived Likelihood     (-) Perceived Impossibility
  (-) Time Delay / (+) Speed   (-) Effort / (+) Ease

WHO: 9 perspectives
  Spouse, Kids, Parents, Boss, Coworkers, Rivals, Friends, Strangers, Self

WHEN: 3 timelines
  Past (where they were), Present (where they are), Future (where they'll be)

Pick 1 from each column = unique ad angle
Total possible: 8 x 9 x 3 = 216 angles per offer
```

**CTA Formula:**
```
[Specific action verb] + [exactly what to do] + [reason(s) to do it now]
```

---

## 7. Scaling Framework (More Better New)

After any Core Four method is producing results, scale in this exact sequence.

### Step 1: MORE

Ask: "What keeps me from doing this at 10x the current volume?"

Solve for that constraint. The answer is usually: time, people, or money.

### Step 2: BETTER

Find the constraint (biggest drop-off in the process). Test one variable per week to improve it.

```
1. Measure conversion at each step
2. Find the step with the biggest drop-off (= the constraint)
3. Test improvements ONLY to that step
4. One variable per week per platform
5. Winners become new control; losers get logged
6. When fixed, find next constraint
7. Repeat
```

### Step 3: NEW (Only After More + Better)

Add a new platform, a new Core Four method, or a new lead getter type.

> "More, better, new. In that order. Always."

---

## 8. Lead Getter Strategies

When you are writing copy to recruit, train, or activate lead getters -- not direct customers.

### 8.1 Customer Referrals

**Prerequisite:** Goodwill = Value - Price must be high. Fix product before asking for referrals.

**Six ways to increase organic referrals:**
1. Sell to better-fit customers (who get better results)
2. Set better expectations (results exceed expectations)
3. Improve success rate across all customers
4. Deliver faster first wins
5. Continuously improve the product
6. Guide customers to their next purchase

**Seven ways to ask:**
1. One-sided reward (referrer gets incentive)
2. Two-sided reward (both referrer and referred get incentive)
3. Ask at purchase moment (peak emotional point)
4. Negotiation chip ("I'll give you X if you refer Y")
5. Referral events (customers bring friends)
6. Ongoing programs (continuous rewards)
7. Unlockable bonuses (referrals unlock features/benefits)

### 8.2 Employees (3Ds Training)

```
D1 - Document:    Create step-by-step checklist of the advertising process
D2 - Demonstrate: Perform the process in front of trainee, narrating each step
D3 - Duplicate:   Have trainee perform it in front of you, correcting in real time
```

Skipping any D creates failure: no documentation = knowledge in one head; no demonstration = misinterpretation; no duplication = unverified competence.

### 8.3 Agencies

Treat as a 6-month learning arrangement, not permanent outsourcing. Learn the skill, transition to consulting, bring the work in-house. Permanent outsourcing = permanent dependency.

### 8.4 Affiliates (6-Step Launch)

```
Step 1: Find ideal affiliates (who already has your audience?)
Step 2: Make them an offer (use Core Four to recruit)
Step 3: Qualify (customer of yours? skilled at Core Four?)
Step 4: Set pay structure (CPA, revenue share, or hybrid)
Step 5: Launch (Whisper-Tease-Shout)
Step 6: Integrate (3 strategies: give away lead magnet / sell lead magnet / sell core offer)
```

**Whisper-Tease-Shout Launch:**
```
WHISPER: Create curiosity. Behind-the-scenes. Hints at something coming.
TEASE:   Reveal value elements. Share proof. Build anticipation.
SHOUT:   Full CTA with urgency + scarcity. "It's here, act now."
```

---

## 9. Financial Metrics for Ads

### Client Financed Acquisition

```
Revenue from new customers within 30 days >= Cost to acquire them
```

If YES: growth is self-financing, scale without limits.
If NO: growth requires external capital, creates cash crunches.

### LTGP:CAC Ratio

```
Lifetime Gross Profit / Customer Acquisition Cost >= 3:1
```

Below 3:1 = unprofitable channel or broken offer. Fix before scaling.

---

## 10. Anti-Patterns

These are failure modes. If you see any of these in the copy or strategy, fix immediately.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| AP-01 | **Volume deficit misdiagnosed as method failure** | Doing 100 outreaches total and concluding "outreach doesn't work." It was 100/day, not 100/ever. |
| AP-02 | **Quit during Lose Money phase** | Stopping paid ads before testing enough to find a winner. Everyone goes through Track -> Lose -> Print. |
| AP-03 | **Platform spread too early** | Starting 4 platforms before mastering 1. Master one completely, then expand. |
| AP-04 | **Strategy-hop instead of volume-up** | "Tried cold outreach for 2 weeks, switching to ads." Check volume first. |
| AP-05 | **Mass-blast cold outreach** | Identical messages to everyone. Zero personalization = zero response rate. |
| AP-06 | **Pitch before value (cold)** | Leading with "buy my thing" instead of providing Big Fast Value first. |
| AP-07 | **Skip ACA in warm outreach** | "Hey want to buy this?" instead of Acknowledge-Compliment-Ask. Burns relationships. |
| AP-08 | **Low give:ask ratio** | Asking every other post. Minimum 3:1. Audience burns out and unfollows. |
| AP-09 | **Hook-only content** | Strong hooks, weak rewards. Gets views once; audience never returns. |
| AP-10 | **Permanent agency dependency** | Using agencies as permanent outsource. You never own the skill. |
| AP-11 | **Referral programs on bad products** | Building referral programs before product creates sufficient goodwill. |
| AP-12 | **Overnight expectations** | Expecting results in days. Hormozi expects 3-6 months to crack new lead sources. |
| AP-13 | **Multiple-variable testing** | Changing headline, image, and audience simultaneously. Cannot attribute results. |
| AP-14 | **No test logging** | Running tests without recording hypotheses, variables, and results. |
| AP-15 | **Fake urgency or scarcity** | Manufactured countdown timers or false limited spots. Destroys credibility permanently. |
| AP-16 | **Content without Hook-Retain-Reward** | Random value delivery without attention mechanics. |
| AP-17 | **Niche-hopping** | Switching target audiences instead of mastering one. Reset all progress each time. |
| AP-18 | **Changing strategy without trying harder** | "It doesn't work" when doing 1/1000th of required volume. |

---

## 11. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Identify the Core Four method first.** Every piece of lead gen copy belongs to exactly one of the four methods. Apply its framework.

2. **Lead with value, never with pitch.** In every medium -- warm, cold, content, ads -- provide value before asking. The ratio is 3:1 minimum.

3. **Hook first, always.** If the hook fails, nobody sees the rest. Use at least one of the seven headline components.

4. **Be specific.** Specific avatars, specific outcomes, specific numbers, specific timeframes. Vague copy converts nobody.

5. **Personalize cold outreach.** Mass blast = zero response. Every cold message must contain something specific to the recipient.

6. **Include a clear, specific CTA with reasons to act now.** Tell them exactly what to do AND why to do it right now. No vague "learn more" without reasons.

7. **Maintain give:ask ratio.** Minimum 3:1 for content. Track it. Every ask burns goodwill that must be rebuilt.

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

8. **Frame benefits through the Value Equation.** Dream Outcome / Perceived Likelihood / Time Delay / Effort. Address the bottom of the equation, not just the top.

9. **Use What-Who-When for ad angles.** 8 x 9 x 3 = 216 angles. Never guess at copy angles when you have a generative framework.

10. **Structure all content as Hook-Retain-Reward.** The three-part structure works across all formats and platforms.

11. **Include proof elements.** Testimonials, case studies, data, results. Proof increases Perceived Likelihood.

12. **Design lead magnets before writing copy for them.** Walk through the 7 steps. Copy cannot sell a poorly designed magnet.

13. **Address objections within the copy.** Every unaddressed objection is a lost lead.

### NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable)

14. **Use the indirect referral ask for warm outreach.** "Do you know anyone who..." protects the relationship and often produces self-referrals.

15. **Apply Whisper-Tease-Shout for launches.** The three-phase sequence builds maximum momentum.

16. **Stack multiple proof types.** Testimonials + case studies + data + personal results = maximum believability.

---

## 12. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing any lead generation copy, verify ALL twelve:

1. **Core Four Alignment:** Is the copy structured correctly for its Core Four method? Warm outreach uses ACA. Content uses Hook-Retain-Reward. Cold uses personalization + value-first. Ads use Callout-Value-CTA.

2. **Hook Test:** Would the target avatar stop scrolling / open this / keep reading? Is there at least one headline component (Recency/Relevancy/Celebrity/Proximity/Conflict/Unusual/Ongoing)?

3. **Avatar Specificity Test:** Can you name the exact person this is for? Would they recognize themselves in the first sentence?

4. **Value-First Test:** Does the copy lead with value or with a pitch? Must be value-first in every method.

5. **Give:Ask Ratio Check:** If content, does this piece maintain the overall 3:1+ give:ask ratio?

6. **CTA Clarity Test:** Is there ONE clear action? Does the reader know EXACTLY what to do? Are there real reasons to act now?

7. **Personalization Check (cold only):** Does this feel personal, not mass-blasted? Is there something specific to the recipient?

8. **Volume Readiness Test:** Can this be sent/posted at the required volume (100/day for outreach)?

9. **Dream Outcome Test:** Does the copy describe the destination (outcome, transformed life) rather than the vehicle (process, membership, features)?

10. **Proof Check:** Is there at least one proof element (testimonial, result, case study, data point)?

11. **Objection Sweep:** List every objection a prospect might raise. Is each addressed? Unaddressed objections lose leads.

12. **Goodwill Check (referral/affiliate copy only):** Does the underlying product deliver sufficient value relative to price to justify the ask?
