# Schwartz Awareness & Sophistication

This skill governs HOW you write all marketing copy. It is not optional. Before writing anything, you must diagnose where the prospect sits on two axes -- awareness and sophistication -- then select your approach accordingly.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**Always.** This skill is auto-active on ALL campaigns. You do not select it; it runs by default.

Before writing any headline, body copy, email, ad, or landing page:
1. Check the focus group or campaign brief for `awarenessStage` and `sophisticationStage`.
2. If not provided, DETERMINE them from the brief's audience description, competitive landscape, and product positioning.
3. If you cannot determine them, ASK before writing a single word.
4. Route all copy decisions through the Awareness x Sophistication Matrix (Section 2.3).

---

## 2. The Core Framework

### 2.1 The Five Stages of Awareness

Every prospect sits at one of five stages. Each stage is separated by a psychological wall. A headline that works at one stage FAILS at another.

| Stage | Name | Definition | What the Prospect Knows |
|-------|------|------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Most Aware** | "The customer knows of your product -- knows what it does -- knows he wants it. At this point, he just hasn't gotten around to buying it yet." | Knows product, wants it, needs a nudge |
| 2 | **Product-Aware** | "Your prospect isn't completely aware of all your product does, or isn't convinced of how well it does it, or hasn't yet been told how much better it does it now." | Knows product exists, not yet sold |
| 3 | **Solution-Aware** | "The prospect either knows, or recognizes immediately, that he wants what the product does; but he doesn't yet know that there is a product -- your product -- that will do it for him." | Knows the desire, not your product |
| 4 | **Problem-Aware** | "The prospect has -- not a desire -- but a need. He recognizes the need immediately. But he doesn't yet realize the connection between the fulfillment of that need and your product." | Has the pain, doesn't know the fix |
| 5 | **Completely Unaware** | "The prospect is either not aware of his desire or his need -- or he won't honestly admit it to himself without being led into it by your ad." | Doesn't recognize the need at all |

### 2.2 The Five Stages of Market Sophistication

How many competitors have already talked to this market? This determines whether you lead with claims, mechanisms, or identity.

| Stage | Name | Definition | Headline Strategy |
|-------|------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Virgin Market** | You are first. No one has sold this type of product to this market. | Be simple. Be direct. Name the desire or claim. |
| 2 | **Second In** | A few competitors have made the direct claim. It still works. | Copy the successful claim but ENLARGE it. Drive to the absolute limit. Outbid. |
| 3 | **Claims Exhausted** | The market has heard all claims in all their extremes. Believability shattered. | Introduce a NEW MECHANISM -- a new way the old promise works. Mechanism moves INTO the headline. |
| 4 | **Mechanisms Competing** | Multiple products tout different mechanisms. | Elaborate the mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer. Remove limitations. |
| 5 | **Market Exhausted** | Nobody believes advertising in this category anymore. | Shift from promise/mechanism to IDENTIFICATION with the prospect. The market no longer believes ads. |

### 2.3 The Awareness x Sophistication Matrix

Cross-reference the two stages. This table tells you exactly what goes in your headline.

| | Soph 1 | Soph 2 | Soph 3 | Soph 4 | Soph 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Aware 1** | Name + Price | Name + Better Price/Offer | N/A (rare) | N/A | N/A |
| **Aware 2** | Name + Claim | Name + Enlarged Claim | Name + Mechanism | Name + Better Mechanism | Identification |
| **Aware 3** | Desire/Solution | Enlarged Desire | Mechanism + Desire | Better Mechanism + Desire | Identification |
| **Aware 4** | Need/Solution | Dramatized Need | Mechanism + Need | Better Mechanism + Need | Identification |
| **Aware 5** | Identification | Identification | Identification | Identification | Identification |

**How to read:** Find the row (awareness) and column (sophistication). The cell tells you what your headline must contain.

## 3. Decision Rules

### DR-01: Headline Content by Awareness Stage

**IF Stage 1 (Most Aware):** Headline = product name + bargain price. Nothing more needed.
- Example: "Revere Zomar Lens, Electric Eye Camera -- Formerly $149.50 -- Now Only $119.95."

**IF Stage 2 (Product-Aware):** Display the product name (headline or large logo) + point out superiority. Choose one of seven sub-tasks:
- (a) Reinforce desire via association, example, sensory sharpening, or illustration
- (b) Sharpen the image of how the product satisfies desire
- (c) Extend the image of where/when the product satisfies desire
- (d) Introduce new proof, details, documentation
- (e) Announce new mechanism enabling better satisfaction
- (f) Announce elimination of former limitations
- (g) Completely change image or mechanism to escape competition

**IF Stage 3 (Solution-Aware):** Name the desire and/or its solution in the headline. Prove the solution can be accomplished. Show the mechanism is in your product.
- Example: "Who else wants a whiter wash -- with no hard work?"

**IF Stage 4 (Problem-Aware):** Name the need and/or its solution in the headline. Dramatize the need vividly. Present your product as the inevitable solution.
- Example: "Shrinks hemorrhoids without surgery."

**IF Stage 5 (Completely Unaware):** Echo an emotion, attitude, or dissatisfaction that binds the audience. Product comes much later in body copy. Build progressive disclosure: Identification -> Growing awareness -> Solution realization -> Product focus.
- Example: "Why Men Crack..."

### DR-02: Elimination Rules for Stage 5

When the market is completely unaware, ELIMINATE from the headline:
1. **Price** -- means nothing to someone who doesn't know or want your product.
2. **Product name** -- means nothing and may actively damage the ad.
3. **Direct statement of function/desire** -- a direct "this product does X" simply will not work.

> "So you cannot mention price, product, function or desire. What do you have left? Your market, of course!"

The headline must identify with the PROSPECT, not describe the product.

### DR-03: Headline Strategy by Sophistication Stage

**IF Stage 1:** "Be simple. Be direct. Above all, don't be fancy. Name either the need or the claim in your headline -- nothing more."

**IF Stage 2:** "Copy that successful claim -- but enlarge on it. Drive it to the absolute limit. Outbid your competition."

**IF Stage 3:** Introduce a NEW MECHANISM. The mechanism moves INTO the headline. The claim gets abbreviated to shorthand.
- Stage 2 structure: Headline = full claim; subhead = abbreviated mechanism.
- Stage 3 structure: Headline = mechanism; subhead = full claim restated.
- Example reversal: Stage 2 = "I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER... NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE." Stage 3 = "FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!"

**IF Stage 4:** "Simply elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer; allow it to solve more of the problem."

**IF Stage 5:** "The emphasis shifts from the promise and the mechanism to identification with the prospect himself." Use identity-based entry points.

### DR-04: When to Shift from Claim to Mechanism

**IF** the market has heard all claims in all their extremes **THEN** "the emphasis shifts from what the product does to HOW it works. Not accomplishment, but performance becomes dominant."

This is the Stage 2 -> Stage 3 pivot. Recognize it by these signals: headlines are doubling in size, words are losing meaning, "whiter-than-whites" appearing, believability shattering.

### DR-05: One Performance Per Headline

> "Every product gives you dozens of keys. But only one will fit the lock."

Your headline has physical space for ONE thought. Choose the dominant performance -- the one that taps the desire with the highest Urgency x Staying Power x Scope. Squeeze every drop of power from it. If the wrong performance is chosen, "nothing else that you do in the ad will matter."

### DR-06: Technique Selection Decision Tree

```
START
  |
  v
Is the product category new/unfamiliar?
  YES -> Lead with GRADUALIZATION (build belief before claims)
  NO  -> continue
  |
Is the market highly sophisticated (many similar claims)?
  YES -> Lead with MECHANIZATION (new mechanism in headline)
         OR CONCENTRATION (destroy competitor claims)
  NO  -> continue
  |
Does the product match competitors on performance?
  YES -> Lead with IDENTIFICATION (build unique role/personality)
  NO  -> continue
  |
Does the product have a clear unique advantage?
  YES -> Lead with INTENSIFICATION (expand and sharpen desire)
  NO  -> continue
  |
Does the product have drawbacks (too hard, expensive, trivial)?
  YES -> Lead with REDEFINITION (remove the objection first)
  NO  -> continue
  |
Default: Lead with INTENSIFICATION + IDENTIFICATION
```

### DR-07: Three Dimensions Routing

**IF** product satisfies a physical want -> Lead with Intensification (desire-building).
**IF** product defines a role or projects personality -> Lead with Identification copy.
**IF** prospect has beliefs that block the sale -> Lead with Gradualization (belief-building).

### DR-08: Prevention Headlines

**IF** selling prevention -> Do NOT picture the disaster happening to the prospect. INSTEAD picture it happening to his loved ones (children, spouse, friends). "A man will not visualize future disasters occurring to himself, but he is perfectly capable of visualizing, and buying preventatives from, the image of such future problems affecting others around him."

## 4. Pre-Writing Checklist

Complete ALL steps before writing a single word.

**Step 1 -- Identify the Mass Desire:**
- [ ] What pre-existing desire does the target market already feel?
- [ ] Score: Urgency (1-10), Staying Power (1-10), Scope (how many people?)
- [ ] Is this a Permanent Force (instinct, health, beauty) or Force of Change (trends, education)?
- [ ] Remember: "Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist."

**Step 2 -- Analyze the Product:**
- [ ] List every functional performance (what the product DOES, not what it IS)
- [ ] Map each performance to the mass desire it satisfies
- [ ] Select the ONE dominant performance (highest Urgency x Staying Power x Scope)
- [ ] Physical product facts are SUPPORTING ONLY -- for price justification, quality documentation, longevity assurance, mental picture sharpening, or fresh believability

**Step 3 -- Determine State of Awareness:**
- [ ] Stage 1: Knows product, wants it, hasn't bought
- [ ] Stage 2: Knows product, not yet convinced
- [ ] Stage 3: Knows what they want done, doesn't know this product does it
- [ ] Stage 4: Has the need, doesn't know a solution exists
- [ ] Stage 5: Doesn't recognize the desire/need or can't admit it

**Step 4 -- Determine State of Sophistication:**
- [ ] Stage 1: No one has sold this type of product to this market before
- [ ] Stage 2: A few competitors have made the direct claim
- [ ] Stage 3: The market has heard all claims in all their extremes
- [ ] Stage 4: Mechanisms are now competing against each other
- [ ] Stage 5: The market no longer believes any advertising in this category

**Step 5 -- Derive Headline Strategy:**
- [ ] Cross-reference Awareness x Sophistication in the matrix (Section 2.3)
- [ ] Determine what MUST be in the headline
- [ ] Determine what must be ELIMINATED from the headline

**Step 6 -- Identify Belief Barriers:**
- [ ] What does the prospect currently believe that blocks the sale?
- [ ] Which existing beliefs can you EXTEND toward acceptance?
- [ ] What bridge of ideas gets them from current belief to your claim?

**Step 7 -- Identify Product Drawbacks:**
- [ ] Is the product too complicated? -> Use Redefinition: Simplification
- [ ] Is the product too unimportant? -> Use Redefinition: Escalation
- [ ] Is the product too expensive? -> Use Redefinition: Price Reduction

**Step 8 -- Determine Competitive Response:**
- [ ] Do you dominate the field? -> Do NOT attack competitors.
- [ ] Are you the underdog? -> Consider Concentration (direct attack).
- [ ] Attack only if you can provide the solution simultaneously.

## 5. Headline Writing

### 5.1 The Headline Decision Tree

```
START
  |
  v
Is the market Most Aware (Stage 1)?
  YES -> [Product Name] + [Price/Offer]. Done.
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Is the market Product-Aware (Stage 2)?
  YES -> [Product Name in headline or logo] + [Superiority claim]
         Choose from 7 sub-tasks: reinforce, sharpen, extend,
         prove, new mechanism, remove limitation, change image.
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Is the market Solution-Aware (Stage 3)?
  YES -> Sophistication Stage 1-2?
           YES -> Name the desire/solution directly. Be simple.
           NO  -> Sophistication Stage 3-4?
                    YES -> Lead with MECHANISM, abbreviate claim.
                    NO  -> Use identification headline.
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Is the market Problem-Aware (Stage 4)?
  YES -> Name the need in headline. Dramatize in body.
         Apply sophistication stage to determine if mechanism
         or identification is needed.
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Market is Completely Unaware (Stage 5).
  -> Eliminate: price, product name, function, desire
  -> Write identification headline (echo emotion/attitude)
  -> Build progressive disclosure in body:
     identification -> awareness -> solution -> product
```

### 5.2 The 38 Verbalization Techniques

After determining headline CONTENT (what to say), use these techniques to determine FORM (how to say it). Select 2-3, draft variants, choose the one with maximum stopping power.

| 38 | **Question and answer** | "YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD... WHO SHOULD YOU SEE IF IT DOESN'T?... SOMEONE WHO CARES -- UNITED DELCO." |

### 5.3 Headline Validation Checklist

Before finalizing ANY headline, verify all of these:

- [ ] Does it match the market's current State of Awareness? (Not too advanced, not too basic)
- [ ] Does it match the market's current State of Sophistication? (Not repeating exhausted claims)
- [ ] Does it channel an EXISTING mass desire? (Not trying to create one)
- [ ] Does it focus on ONE dominant performance/desire? (Not trying to say everything)
- [ ] Does it compel the reader to read the second sentence? (Not trying to sell in the headline)
- [ ] If Stage 5 awareness: Does it IDENTIFY with the market? (Not just clever/cute/startling)
- [ ] If Stage 5 awareness: Does it reject non-prospects as much as it attracts prospects?
- [ ] Is it about the FUNCTIONAL product (what it does), not the physical product (what it is)?
- [ ] Has this exact approach been exhausted by competitors? If yes, advance sophistication stage.

## 6. Body Copy Techniques

### 6.1 Intensification: 13 Techniques for Strengthening Desire

> "Your job is to fill out these vague desires with concrete images -- to show your prospect every possible way that they can be fulfilled."

Core rule: The prospect takes away ONE dominant image. Every additional perspective sharpens that SAME image -- do not introduce different benefits. Reinforce, do not repeat.

| # | Technique | What to Do |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Direct Description** | Present the product or its satisfaction bluntly, with thorough detail of appearance or results. |
| 2 | **Product-in-Action** | Show not just benefits but exactly HOW the product delivers them. Put the product in motion. |
| 3 | **Bring In the Reader** | Give the reader a verbal demonstration of what happens the FIRST DAY they own the product. |
| 4 | **Demonstration-Test** | Turn the demonstration into a test. Let the reader visualize proving the performance themselves. |
| 5 | **Stretch Benefits in Time** | Show the product at work over weeks and months. Extend the reader's vision further into the future. |
| 6 | **Bring In an Audience** | Celebrities via testimonial; average people via case history. Each provides a fresh perspective on the same promise. |
| 7 | **Show Experts Approving** | "There is nothing so astounding as the astonishment of experts." Let the discriminating register their approval. |
| 8 | **Compare, Contrast, Prove Superiority** | Old product disadvantages side-by-side with new product advantages. |
| 9 | **Picture the Black Side** | Paint the negative in full color. Irritate the wound, then apply the salve. Two currents: repulsion from problem + attraction to solution. |
| 10 | **Show How Easy** | At every touchpoint (price, use, durability, portability) furnish a fresh perspective to reiterate benefits. |
| 11 | **Metaphor, Analogy, Imagination** | Present facts more dramatically. Personify the product. Use extended analogies. |
| 12 | **Catalog Summary** | Brief condensed listing. Horizontal (expanding applications) or vertical (deepening desire by piling desire upon desire). |
| 13 | **Guarantee as Climax** | Turn the guarantee into the climax -- the final summary of performances reinforced at every step by the guarantee itself. |

**When to stop:** "As long as each additional fresh perspective continues to build the dominant desire, use it. But if the additional perspective is not different or dramatic enough to renew interest, leave it out."

### 6.2 Identification: Character Roles + Achievement Roles

> "Every product you work on should offer your prospect two separate and distinct reasons for buying it. First, fulfillment of a physical want. Second, a particular method of fulfilling that need that defines him to the outside world as a particular kind of human being."

**Character Roles** -- Expressed by adjectives: "progressive," "chic," "brilliant," "well-read." Partly unconscious, subject to fantasy. The prospect is MORE ready to believe character roles than performance claims.

**Achievement Roles** -- Expressed by nouns/titles: "Executive," "Home Owner," "$20,000-a-year Man," "Good Mother." Status symbols that society recognizes.

**Building identification:**
1. Identify the primary image the product already has.
2. Use it as raw material to construct double/triple images drawing in more desired roles.
3. Never contradict the accepted primary image. Build from it as a bridge.

> "If you demand that your prospect jump across a believability-chasm, your ad will fail. If, however, you build a bridge of ideas or images across that chasm -- starting on his side -- then he will let you lead him almost anywhere."

### 6.3 Gradualization: Building Belief Step by Step

> "If you violate your prospect's established beliefs in the slightest degree -- either in content or direction -- then nothing you promise him, no matter how appealing, can save your ad."

> "One fully-believed promise has ten times the sales power of ten partially-believed promises."

**Six Gradualization Devices:**

1. **Inclusion Question** -- Ask a question where 95%+ answer YES. Builds Habit of Agreement. ("Was your set purchased after the spring of 1947?")
2. **Detailed Identification** -- Detail symptoms/problems that ARE the prospect's situation. Reader knows you're talking about HIM.
3. **Contradiction of False Beliefs** -- Say bluntly "I know you think X; I'll show you it's false." Best with strong authority.
4. **Language of Logic** -- Interlace promises with logic-signals: "therefore," "here's why," "the reason for this is clear," "it has been proved by thousands." These words carry conviction by centuries of conditioning.
5. **Syllogistic Thinking** -- Build formal logical structures where one statement inevitably leads to the next. Create a feeling of inevitability.
6. **Other Belief Forms** -- Contingency structures ("If... then..."), echoing repetition ("These experts found... These experts found..."), promise-belief-promise alternation, paragraph parallelism.

### 6.4 Redefinition: Reframing Product Drawbacks

> "Redefinition is the process of giving a new definition to your product. It says that the product is this rather than that."

**Type 1: Simplification** -- When the product sounds too hard. Do NOT scream "EASY." Instead, redefine the entire field before introducing your product. "Innovation without acceptance is valueless."

**Type 2: Escalation** -- When appeal isn't broad enough. Three strategies:
- Increase benefit appeal (shift to a more desirable area)
- Increase importance (show something the prospect values hinges on your product)
- Increase frequency (show the product is needed almost every waking minute)

**Type 3: Price Reduction** -- When price is too high. Switch the comparison to a more expensive standard. Concept-judo: turn a liability into an asset.

### 6.5 Mechanization: Explaining HOW the Product Works

The prospect's silent demand: "How does it work?" Three stages of response:

**Stage 1: Name it.** If the prospect already knows how this type of product works, a word or phrase suffices. ("With Electronic Light Setter... Push-Button Zomar Lens...")

**Stage 2: Describe it.** If the mechanism is new, describe it in selling language. "The first rule of mechanism copy is that it is not scientific discourse. You must never allow it to become dull, or merely factual. You must load it with promise, load it with emotion."

**Stage 3: Feature it.** If you have an exceptionally strong mechanism OR the market is highly sophisticated, put the mechanism in the headline. The mechanism BECOMES the main claim. ("FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!")

Also: Price cuts must be justified with a mechanism explaining WHY the price is reduced. Without a reason-why, you get only a fraction of real sales power.

### 6.6 Concentration: Destroying Competitor Claims

> "No successful copy ever sells a product. It sells a way of satisfying a particular desire."

**When to use:** When your budget is much less than competitors, or most prospects are already their customers. Your first problem is to crack their image and shatter loyalty.

**When NOT to use:** If you dominate the field. Don't give competitors the prestige of attack.

**Critical rule:** "Never attack a weakness unless you can provide the solution to that weakness at the same time!" Attack for the customer's benefit, not your own.

**Two structures:**
1. **Interweaving Contrast** -- Bad-good-bad-good. Weakness in competitor, immediately counteracted by your benefit. Point-by-point demolition.
2. **Time-Sequence** -- What happens now (with old product) -> What happens when you switch. Define old methods as passive, narrate failure, climax with breakdown, transition to hero product.

### 6.7 Camouflage: Matching Publication Style

> "A conditioned reflex has been formed. The man believes in the publication. The publication phrases its material in a certain way. After a while, that phraseology begins to carry an aura of truth all by itself."

**Three methods:**
1. **Adopt the Format** -- Match the publication's headline type, sub-headline treatment, illustration style, column layout, and typographic details. "A single change in format can add 50% to your readership."
2. **Adopt the Phraseology** -- Borrow stereotyped phrases that carry truth-aura. For newspapers: date, city, by-line, news-style opening. For direct mail: mimic refund checks, government correspondence.
3. **Adopt Believability Moods** --
   - **Understatement:** Simplicity, lack of color words, fewer adjectives than expected. No superlatives. Short sentences that fall in tone.
   - **Deadly Sincerity:** Lean over backwards to point out flaws, so benefits get believed more deeply.

---

## 7. The Final Touches

### 7.1 Verification: Proof Placement

> "Proof -- like claims -- is most effective when the reader unconsciously demands it, and when he is ready to accept its content as necessary and logical."

Rules:
- Keep proof short, dramatic, specific.
- Proof copy must SELL. It cannot merely offer proof. Make the prospect hungry to read every word of it.
- Stage your proof. Develop a drama into which documentation enters as the hero.
- Do NOT dump proof in a separate section. INTERWEAVE documentation alongside promises, belief-words, momentum-builders, image-sharpeners, and emotion-definers.
- "Documentation is inherently dull. Your job is to add excitement to it."

Three types of belief-builders -- know the difference:
- **Documentation** = outside proof (statistics, facts, tests, testimonials)
- **Mechanization** = verbal/logical demonstration that it works
- **Verification** = arranging documentation within copy for greatest acceptance

### 7.2 Reinforcement: 1+1=10

> "In mathematics, one plus one always equals two -- never more. In emotional writing, one plus one can often equal ten."

Two emotional images joined correctly can have TEN TIMES the impact of either alone. "Position increases power."

Example -- Avis: "We try harder" (good alone) + "We're only second" (the reason why) = combined impact far greater than either.

Example -- Deadly Sincerity: "This is John Horn's first book. He is not an accomplished writer, and it has flaws." -> The startling frankness makes the NEXT paragraph's claims far more believable.

Look for juxtapositions where admission + claim create compound impact.

### 7.3 Interweaving: Promise + Logic + Emotion in Every Sentence

> "Every sentence you write should contain not only promise... not only image... not only logic -- but as much of all three as possible."

Seven copy elements can live in a single sentence: mood-builder, authority reference, scientific idiom, core promise, restatement, ease promise, condensed claim. Done unconsciously by the writer, absorbed unconsciously by the reader.

No "dead" sentences. If a sentence only conveys information without selling, rewrite it.

### 7.4 Sensitivity: Anticipation Points

> "Every ad has an architecture. This is the over-all pattern of the ad, including when and where and how many times you shift from one type of copy to another."

Signs you have passed an anticipation point and must shift copy type:
- Piling on promises when the reader no longer believes you -> shift to proof
- Burying the reader under statistics when he's already convinced -> shift to promises
- Going straight when the reader wants to turn left -> find a new direction

"A new structure is a new ad. It brings out new ideas."

### 7.5 Momentum: Keeping Readers Reading

**Type 1: Momentum Phrases** -- Invitations to read on:
- "Here's how."
- "Let me explain."
- "And yet it's only the beginning."
- "For example --"
- "Just wait till you try this."
- "Read the thrilling answer below."
- "All I ask from you is this."

**Type 2: Incomplete Statements / Teasers** -- Raise a question, imply an answer later:
- "But now, when you turn on the ignition, a modern miracle of engineering science comes to life underneath your hood!"
- "Caught! 120 Fish in One Hour!"

Every momentum device must also SELL. No pulling forward without adding desire/proof/identification.

### 7.6 Mood: Emotion-Definers

> "Words and rhythms. They are to the copy writer what line and color are to the painter."

**Image-Sharpeners** -- Words that create visual pictures: "weighted down... solid, blazing rows... so thick you can't even see a leaf in between."

**Emotion-Definers** -- Words that tell the reader what to FEEL: "precious... that very morning... blinded... greets... you never imagined before." Their power is in their subtlety. If the reader sees them, you've failed.

Match rhythm to mood:
- **Color/beauty/excitement:** Rich, flowing, almost scannable rhythms with dense imagery
- **Power/momentum:** Machine-gun rhythm. Short, choppy. Verb... verb... verb. Claim... claim... claim.
- **Sincerity:** Absence of expected adjectives. Self-kidding. Builds affection, then trust.
- **Honest appraisal:** Long, rather clumsy sentences. Straight-from-the-shoulder.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

These are FAILURE MODES. Violate any of these and the copy dies.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| AP-01 | **Creating desire from nothing** | "It would be impossible for any one advertiser to spend enough money to actually create this mass desire." Chrysler (1948), Ford safety (1954), Edsel -- all catastrophic failures from fighting desire instead of channeling it. |
| AP-02 | **Wrong-stage headline** | A Stage 1 headline to a Stage 3 market = old news. A Stage 3 headline to a Stage 1 market = incomprehensible. "A headline that will work wonders in the first stage will fail completely when addressed to a market in another stage." |
| AP-03 | **Empty Stage 5 headline** | "It cannot simply be a startler, or an attention-getter, or humorous, or cute." Most writers use Stage 5 as an excuse for empty cleverness. This wastes the client's money. |
| AP-04 | **Non-identifying Stage 5 headline** | "Your prospect must identify with your headline before he can buy from it. It must be HIS headline, HIS problem." It must reject non-prospects as much as it attracts prospects. |
| AP-05 | **Copying yourself** | "The more successful the copy writer, the greater the temptation to find his new headline in his old files. But it won't work." Every product-market-timing relationship is unique. |
| AP-06 | **Echo Ads** | Swapping product names into proven headline templates. "They become Echo Ads -- ads that remind people of some other product." They lose all strengths of the unique product-market relationship. |
| AP-07 | **Over-enlargement decay** | Stage 2 pushed too far. Headlines double in size. Words lose meaning. "Whiter-than-whites" appear. Believability shatters. Signal to shift to Stage 3 mechanisms. |
| AP-08 | **Selling in the headline** | "To demand that a headline should sell is to place the full selling burden on 10% to 20% of the total physical space of your ad." The headline's only job is to compel reading the second sentence. |
| AP-09 | **Repeating instead of reinforcing** | Exact same phrasing repeated = reader lost. Same promise in a NEW context = reinforcement. "You cannot repeat, but you can reinforce." |
| AP-10 | **Violating beliefs** | "If you violate your prospect's established beliefs in the slightest degree -- either in content or direction -- then nothing you promise him can save your ad." |
| AP-11 | **Piling promises** | "Most copy writers try to strengthen ads by piling promise upon promise. What they usually get is greater sales resistance." One fully-believed promise beats ten half-believed ones. |
| AP-12 | **Unbelievable identification** | "Many campaigns have collapsed because they have asked their market to identify with an unbelievable image." The image gap kills credibility for ALL claims. |
| AP-13 | **Contradicting primary image** | "You cannot contradict accepted images or beliefs in advertising. This is not advertising's role." Build FROM the accepted image, never against it. |
| AP-14 | **Visible emotion-definers** | "Certain classes of readers will notice these emotion-definers. When they do, your copy becomes either questionable or corny." If EVERYBODY sees them, you have a bad ad. |
| AP-15 | **Attacking without solving** | "Never attack a weakness unless you can provide the solution to that weakness at the same time!" Self-serving attacks evoke skepticism. |

## 9. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Never violate the prospect's established beliefs.** Every statement must fit their version of "the facts." You cannot change beliefs; you can only extend them.

2. **One fully-believed promise beats ten half-believed promises.** Invest in believability-structure, not claim-piling.

3. **Every sentence must sell.** Including mechanism copy, proof copy, and transitional copy. No dead sentences anywhere.

4. **Never repeat the same phrasing.** You cannot repeat, but you CAN reinforce. Present the same promise in fresh settings.

5. **Never attack without solving.** Attack competitors only if you simultaneously provide the solution.

6. **Never force a believability-chasm.** Always build a bridge from what the prospect already believes.

7. **Never contradict the product's accepted primary image.** Build on it, use it as a foundation.

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

8. **Pack every sentence with promise + logic + emotion.** Interweave so they reinforce each other.

9. **Use the language of logic throughout.** "Therefore," "here's why," "the reason is clear" -- these carry conviction by centuries of conditioning.

10. **Match copy tone to audience sophistication.** What works for one class of media may fail in another.

11. **Build proof into the copy flow, not a separate section.** Stage documentation as the hero of a drama.

12. **Use momentum-builders to keep the reader going.** Incomplete statements, teasers, and explicit invitations to read on.

13. **Use the guarantee as a climax, not an afterthought.** Summarize performances reinforced by the guarantee at every step.

### NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable)

14. **Adapt format and phraseology to match the publication.** Camouflage the ad as editorial content.

15. **Use understatement or deadly sincerity** in highly skeptical markets to break the advertising stereotype.

16. **Read the copy out loud.** Check rhythms match the intended mood.

## 10. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify ALL ten:

1. **Belief Architecture:** Does every claim have preparation before it? Could the most powerful claim be delayed until after sufficient acceptance is built?

2. **Anticipation Points:** At each paragraph break, is the reader demanding more of the SAME type of copy, or is he ready for a shift? Have you shifted when needed?

3. **Interweaving:** Does each sentence carry multiple elements (promise, logic, emotion, image)? Or are there dead sentences that only convey information?

4. **Reinforcement:** Are there juxtapositions where 1+1=10? Can two images be placed together for compound impact?

5. **Momentum:** Will the reader keep reading at every point? Are there teasers and incomplete statements that pull forward?

6. **Identification Test:** Does the copy give the prospect a ROLE, not just a product? Can someone see WHO they become by using this?

7. **Believability Scan:** Read the copy as a skeptic. At what point would you stop believing? That's where you need more Gradualization, Mechanization, or Verification.

8. **Tone Consistency:** Read aloud. Does the rhythm match the mood? Are emotion-definers invisible or do they call attention to themselves?

9. **Competition Test:** Could you put another brand name on this copy without changing anything? If so, you need more product-specific mechanism or identification.

10. **The "Would I cite this?" Test:** Is every paragraph doing work? If a paragraph doesn't build desire, identification, OR belief -- cut it.

## 11. Key Quotes Reference

Use these for calibration. They encode the foundational principles.

> "The power, the force, the overwhelming urge to own that makes advertising work, comes from the market itself, and not from the copy. Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already-existing desires onto a particular product."

> "Your headline has only one job -- to stop your prospect and compel him to read the second sentence of your ad."

> "Every product gives you dozens of keys. But only one will fit the lock."

> "A headline which will work to a market in one stage of awareness will not work to a market in another stage of awareness."

> "You are literally the script writer for your prospect's dreams. You are the chronicler of his future."

> "You cannot repeat, but you can reinforce."

> "If you demand that your prospect jump across a believability-chasm, your ad will fail. If, however, you build a bridge of ideas or images across that chasm -- starting on his side -- then he will let you lead him almost anywhere."

> "If you violate your prospect's established beliefs in the slightest degree -- either in content or direction -- then nothing you promise him, no matter how appealing, can save your ad."

> "One fully-believed promise has ten times the sales power of ten partially-believed promises."

> "Effective advertising, like effective literature, is built -- not of words -- but of reactions."

> "Innovation without acceptance is valueless."

> "No successful copy ever sells a product. It sells a way of satisfying a particular desire."

> "In mathematics, one plus one always equals two -- never more. In emotional writing, one plus one can often equal ten."

> "Words and rhythms. They are to the copy writer what line and color are to the painter."

> "Advertising is salesmanship in print. Therefore, above everything else, advertising is the literature of desire. It is society's encyclopedia of dreams."

> "Keep reading. Keep analyzing. Keep writing. Keep looking for the new idea -- the million dollars hidden somewhere in that typewriter of yours. Always shoot for the moon -- it's one of the few real thrills left today!"
