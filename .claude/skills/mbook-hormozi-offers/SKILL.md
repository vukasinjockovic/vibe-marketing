# Hormozi Offer Construction

This skill governs HOW you structure, price, and present any product or service offer. It is on-demand -- activated when the campaign involves selling something. Before writing any offer copy, you must build the offer structure first, then enhance it, then name it.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**On-demand.** Selected when the campaign involves a product or service offer -- landing pages, sales pages, VSL scripts, email sequences with an ask, webinar pitches, or any asset where the prospect is presented with something to buy.

Before writing any offer copy:
1. Check the brief for market definition, pricing position, and product/service details.
2. If not provided, DETERMINE the market (Health, Wealth, or Relationships), the niche avatar, and the pricing tier.
3. Score the current offer against the Value Equation (Section 2.1). If any variable scores below 5/10, fix the offer structure before writing copy.
4. Build or verify the Grand Slam Offer structure (Section 5) before drafting a single sentence.
5. Apply the Enhancement Stack in order: Scarcity, Urgency, Bonuses, Guarantees, Naming (Section 6).
6. If the brief lacks enough information to complete the Pre-Writing Checklist (Section 4), ASK before writing.

## 2. Core Framework

### 2.1 The Value Equation

This is the master formula. Every offer decision flows from it.

```
                Dream Outcome  x  Perceived Likelihood of Achievement
Value = -----------------------------------------------------------------------
              Perceived Time Delay  x  Perceived Effort & Sacrifice
```

**TOP (increase these):**
- **(+) Dream Outcome** -- What the prospect gets. The destination, not the vehicle.
- **(+) Perceived Likelihood of Achievement** -- How certain they feel THIS will work for THEM.

**BOTTOM (decrease these):**
- **(-) Perceived Time Delay** -- How long until they see results.
- **(-) Perceived Effort & Sacrifice** -- How hard it is, what they must give up.

> "The reason this is a division equation and not an addition ('+') is that I wanted to convey one key point. If you can make the bottom part of the equation equal to zero, you're golden. No matter how small the top side is, anything divided by zero equals infinity."

**The Infinite Value Test:** If the prospect clicks "buy" and instantly gets the dream outcome with zero effort, that is infinite value. Every offer improvement moves toward this ideal.

**The Four Questions Every Prospect Asks:**

| Question | Value Driver | Copy Must Answer |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| "What will I make/get?" | Dream Outcome | Specific, measurable result + status gain |
| "How will I know it's going to happen?" | Perceived Likelihood | Proof, testimonials, guarantees, track record |
| "How long will it take?" | Time Delay | Speed promises, fast wins, timeline |
| "What is expected of me?" | Effort & Sacrifice | Done-for-you elements, simplicity, convenience |

### 2.2 The Grand Slam Offer

> "It's an offer you present to the marketplace that cannot be compared to any other product or service available, combining an attractive promotion, an unmatchable value proposition, a premium price, and an unbeatable guarantee with a money model (payment terms) that allows you to get paid to get new customers... forever removing the cash constraint on business growth."

A Grand Slam Offer produces three multiplicative effects:
1. **Increased Response Rates** -- more people click/act on the ad
2. **Increased Conversion** -- more of those people buy
3. **Premium Prices** -- they buy at higher prices

```
Response Rate Multiplier x Conversion Multiplier x Price Multiplier = Total Revenue Multiplier
```

> "2.5 x 2.5 x 4 = 22.4x more cash collected up front."

The offer eliminates comparison. The prospect's decision becomes "your product vs. nothing" rather than "your product vs. competitor."

### 2.3 The Three Core Markets

All offers must connect to one of three evergreen markets:

| Market | Why It Persists |
|--------|----------------|
| **Health** | Tremendous pain when lacking it |
| **Wealth** | Tremendous pain when lacking it |
| **Relationships** | Tremendous pain when lacking it |

If your offer does not connect to health, wealth, or relationships, reconsider the market.

### 2.4 The Price-to-Value Discrepancy

The goal: perceived value dramatically exceeds price. Never close the gap by lowering price. Always widen the gap by increasing perceived value.

> "So the goal of our Grand Slam Offer will be to get more people to say yes at a higher price by increasing our value to price discrepancy. In other words, we will raise our price only after we have sufficiently increased our value."

---

## 3. Decision Rules

### Market Selection Rules

**DR-01: Starving Crowd Priority.**
IF choosing between a great market, a great offer, or great persuasion, THEN prioritize: Starving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills. A great market makes money even with a bad offer.

**DR-02: Four Market Indicators.**
IF selecting a market, THEN it must have ALL of: (1) Massive Pain, (2) Purchasing Power, (3) Easy to Target, (4) Growing. If ANY indicator is missing, the market will fail you.

**DR-03: Three Core Markets.**
IF your offer does not connect to health, wealth, or relationships, THEN reconsider the market.

**DR-04: Niche Commitment.**
IF you are under $10M/year revenue, THEN niche down further. Do not switch niches until you have exhausted offer variations within the current niche.

### Pricing Rules

**DR-05: Premium Pricing Imperative.**
IF setting prices, THEN charge premium. Never compete on price unless you have a revolutionary 1/10th cost advantage.

> "There is no strategic benefit to being the second cheapest in the marketplace, but there is for being the most expensive."

**DR-06: Price-Value Gap.**
IF you want to charge more, THEN first increase perceived value, THEN raise price. The gap must always show value >> price.

**DR-07: Price Creates Value.**
IF you raise your price, THEN you literally increase the perceived value. Higher price triggers the assumption of higher quality.

**DR-08: 100x Niche Pricing.**
IF you niche down your product, THEN you can charge up to 100x more for the same core content. "Time Management" ($19) becomes "Time Management for B2B Outbound Power Tools & Gardening Sales Reps" ($1,000-$2,000).

**DR-09: Virtuous Cycle of Price.**
IF you raise prices, THEN: higher emotional investment -> higher perceived value -> better results -> best clients -> multiplied margins -> better service -> can charge even more. IF you lower prices, the cycle reverses destructively.

### Value Equation Rules

**DR-10: Bottom-Side Focus.**
IF you want to build something exceptional, THEN focus on decreasing Time Delay and Effort & Sacrifice. This is harder and more competitive than inflating dream outcomes.

> "The best companies in the world focus all their attention on the bottom side of the equation. Making things immediate, seamless, and effortless."

**DR-11: Psychological vs. Logical Solutions.**
IF a logical solution already exists, THEN look for a psychological solution. Logical solutions have been tried because they are logical.

**DR-12: Fast Beats Free.**
IF competing against free alternatives, THEN compete on speed. People will pay for speed.

**DR-13: Fast Win.**
IF you sell something with a long time-to-result, THEN create an early emotional win as close to purchase as possible.

**DR-14: Status Frame.**
IF writing benefit copy, THEN frame benefits in terms of status gained as perceived by others.

**DR-15: Perception is Reality.**
It does not matter how much you ACTUALLY improve the four value drivers. It only matters how much the prospect PERCEIVES the improvement.

### Offer Construction Rules

**DR-16: Sell the Vacation, Not the Flight.**
IF writing offer copy, THEN describe the destination (dream outcome), not the mechanism (process/membership/service).

**DR-17: Solve Every Problem.**
IF a prospect raises an objection or perceived obstacle, THEN solve it within the offer. Each unsolved problem is a lost sale.

**DR-18: Pain is the Pitch.**
IF writing sales copy, THEN articulate the prospect's pain accurately. If you do this well, they will almost always buy.

**DR-19: Persuasion vs. Understanding.**
IF writing marketing copy, THEN the goal is for the prospect to feel understood, not for them to understand you.

**DR-20: One-to-Many Priority.**
IF choosing a delivery vehicle, THEN prioritize "one to many" solutions. These have the biggest discrepancy between cost and value.

**DR-21: Trim Decision.**
When trimming solutions: (1) FIRST remove high cost, low value. (2) THEN remove low cost, low value. (3) KEEP low cost, high value AND high cost, high value.

**DR-22: Sales-Fulfillment Continuum.**
IF starting out, THEN over-deliver (easy to sell, hard to fulfill). Use cash flow to optimize. IF scaling, THEN add friction and reduce delivery while maintaining value.

### Enhancement Rules (Scarcity)

**DR-23: Always Sell Out.**
IF using scarcity, THEN set supply BELOW what you think you can sell, and always sell out. This compounds over time.

**DR-24: Announce Sold Out.**
IF you sold out, THEN let everyone know. This creates social proof and increases future desire.

**DR-25: Honest Scarcity.**
The easiest scarcity strategy is honesty. Sharing that you are 81% to capacity moves people over the edge.

**DR-26: Fractal Demand.**
IF you have 10 prospects willing to pay $500, THEN approximately 2 are willing to pay $5,000. Skim the top of the pyramid with fewer, higher-priced slots.

### Enhancement Rules (Urgency)

**DR-27: Deadlines Drive Decisions.**
IF using urgency, THEN always use REAL deadlines. Fake deadlines destroy credibility.

**DR-28: Price Change Pipeline Cleaning.**
IF raising prices, THEN always let people know before raising. Never raise prices without notice.

**DR-29: Last-Day Phenomenon.**
The biggest sales on a campaign happen in the last 4 hours of the last day (up to 50-60% of total sales). Structure campaigns to exploit this.

### Enhancement Rules (Bonuses)

**DR-30: Never Discount, Always Add Bonuses.**
IF trying to close a deal, THEN never discount the main offer. Add bonuses to increase value instead.

**DR-31: Bonus Value Eclipses Core.**
The total value of bonuses should eclipse the value of the core offer. This expands the price-to-value discrepancy.

**DR-32: Tools Over Trainings.**
Tools and checklists are better than additional trainings as bonuses. Lower effort and time = higher value per the Value Equation.

**DR-33: Ask First, Bonus Second (1-on-1).**
IF selling one-on-one, THEN ask for the sale FIRST. If YES, reveal bonuses as a wow. If NO, present a bonus that matches their objection, then ask again.

### Enhancement Rules (Guarantees)

**DR-34: Guarantee Power Formula.**
Every guarantee must follow: "If you do not get [X result] in [Y time], we will [Z]." Without the "or what" portion, the guarantee sounds weak.

**DR-35: Guarantee Math.**
IF a guarantee increases sales by 30% and refunds double from 5% to 10%, THEN net sales increase 23%. Guarantees almost always pay for themselves.

**DR-36: Guarantee Type by Context.**
IF lower ticket B2C, THEN use bigger unconditional guarantees. IF higher ticket B2B, THEN use specific conditional guarantees. IF high fulfillment cost, THEN use conditional or anti-guarantee. IF starting out, THEN use service guarantee or performance model.

**DR-37: Stack Guarantees.**
Like bonuses, you can stack guarantees. Unconditional 30-day + Conditional 90-day = maximum conversion power.

### Enhancement Rules (Naming)

**DR-38: M-A-G-I-C Formula.**
IF naming an offer, THEN use 3-5 of: Magnetic reason why, Avatar call-out, Goal, Interval, Container word. Apply to every sub-item and bonus too.

**DR-39: No Quantifiable Claims + Time on Ad Platforms.**
IF the goal is a quantifiable claim (income, weight loss), THEN do NOT pair it with a time interval on advertising platforms. Use non-claim goals instead.

**DR-40: Change Wrapper Before Core.**
IF ads fatigue, THEN change creative, then copy, then headline, then duration, then enhancer, then monetization structure -- in that order. Never jump to changing the core offer.

---

## 5. Grand Slam Offer Construction

Follow these five steps in order. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Identify Dream Outcome

Define what the prospect actually wants -- the destination, not the vehicle.

- What does the prospect's life look like AFTER?
- What status gain do they achieve?
- How will others perceive them differently?

> "I wasn't selling my membership anymore. I wasn't selling the plane flight. I was selling the vacation."

Frame as: "You will [specific measurable outcome] so that [status/life change]."

### Step 2: List Problems (Minimum 16 Core, 32+ Sub-Problems)

List ALL obstacles the prospect will encounter before, during, and after using your product/service. For each core activity the prospect must do, generate sub-problems across all four value drivers:

```
For each activity (buying, doing, maintaining, etc.):
  |
  +-- Dream Outcome concerns: "This will not be financially worth it"
  +-- Likelihood concerns: "It won't work for me specifically"
  +-- Effort concerns: "This will be too hard / confusing / I won't like it"
  +-- Time concerns: "This will take too long / I'm too busy"
  +-- Sustainability: "What about when I travel / have conflicts / edge cases?"
```

### Step 3: Convert Problems to Solutions

Transform every problem into a solution using the reversal template:

```
PROBLEM: [Activity] is [negative]
SOLUTION: "How to [activity] [positive outcome], so that [anyone/avatar] can [benefit]"
```

Specific patterns:
- Hard/confusing -> "How to make [activity] easy and enjoyable"
- Takes too long -> "How to [activity] quickly"
- Too expensive -> "How to [activity] for less than [benchmark]"
- Unsustainable -> "How to make [activity] take less effort than [bad alternative]"
- Conflicts with priorities -> "How to [activity] while also [handling conflict]"
- Fails in edge cases -> "How to [activity] even when [edge case]"

### Step 4: Create Delivery Vehicles (Product Delivery Cheat Codes)

For each solution, brainstorm delivery vehicles across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| Personal attention | One-on-one, small group, one to many |
| Effort level | DIY (figure it out), DWY (you teach), DFY (you do it) |
| If live, medium | In-person, phone, email, text, Zoom, chat |
| If recorded, format | Audio, video, written |
| Response speed | 24/7, 9-5, within 5 min, within 1 hour, within 24 hours |

**The 10x/1-10th Test:**
- "If my customers paid me 10x my price (or $100,000), what would I provide?"
- "If they paid me 1/10th the price and I had to make it MORE valuable, how would I do that?"

### Step 5: Trim & Stack

**5a: Trim**

```
REMOVE FIRST:  High cost + Low value
REMOVE SECOND: Low cost + Low value
KEEP:          Low cost + High value
KEEP:          High cost + High value
```

Prioritize "one to many" solutions -- biggest discrepancy between cost and value.

**5b: Stack & Name**

Bundle remaining items. For each, use this presentation format:

```
[Problem Area] -> [Sexy Name for Bundle]
  ...that'll [benefit statement addressing main pain point]
  ($[assigned value] value [+ justification for that value])

  Includes:
  - Component 1
  - Component 2
  - Component 3
```

End with the total value vs. actual price:
```
Total Value: $[sum of all component values]
All for only $[actual price].
```

---

## 6. The Enhancement Stack

Apply in this exact order: Scarcity -> Urgency -> Bonuses -> Guarantees -> Naming. Each builds on the previous.

### 6.1 Scarcity (Decrease Supply)

> "Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain."

**Three Types of Scarcity:**

| Type | What It Is | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Limited Supply of Seats/Slots | Cap total or per-period availability | Services, programs, cohorts |
| Limited Supply of Bonuses | Bonuses available only to first X buyers | Any offer type |
| Never Available Again | This specific version/release will not return | Product launches, limited editions |

**Scarcity Type Selection:**

```
START
  |
  Physical product?
  YES --> Limited release (cap quantity, monthly cadence, announce sold-out)
  NO  --> Service?
          YES --> How do you cap?
                  Fixed total clients? --> Total Business Cap
                    Template: "My agency only services 25 customers. Period."
                  Fixed per period? --> Growth Rate Cap
                    Template: "We only accept 5 new clients per week."
                  Fixed per cohort? --> Cohort Cap
                    Template: "We take 100 clients 4 times a year."
                  Very small exclusive group? --> Add No-Return Policy
          |
          ALL --> Layer on Honest Scarcity (share % to capacity)
          |
          Want extreme premium? --> Cap 1-on-1 access at tiny number, price very high
```

**Critical Rules:**
- Always sell out. Set supply BELOW expected demand.
- Always announce sold-out. This compounds over time.
- Monthly cadence is the sweet spot for limited releases.
- Scarcity implies social proof: "If 81% full, lots of people chose this."

### 6.2 Urgency (Decrease Time to Decide)

> "Scarcity is a function of quantity. Urgency is a function of time."

**Four Types of Urgency:**

| Type | What It Is | Template |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Cohort-Based Rolling | Next group starts on a date | "If you sign up today, you're in our Monday group. Otherwise, wait until next month." |
| Rolling Seasonal | Same offer, new seasonal wrapper + date | "Our New Year Promotion ends Jan 30!" -> "Our Valentine's Promo ends Feb 28!" |
| Pricing/Bonus-Based | The deal changes, not the service | "This bonus/discount is only available for the next 48 hours." |
| Exploding Opportunity | Arbitrage that decays with time | "Every day you wait, the advantage shrinks." |

**Urgency Type Selection:**

```
START
  |
  Start clients in groups/cohorts?
  YES --> Cohort-Based Rolling Urgency
         (less frequent kickoffs = more powerful urgency)
  NO  --> Seasonal or time-bound promotion?
          YES --> Rolling Seasonal Urgency
                 (new wrapper + deadline on same core service)
          NO  --> Can you rotate pricing/bonus deals?
                  YES --> Pricing or Bonus-Based Urgency
                         (urgency on the DEAL, not the service)
                  NO  --> Time-decay arbitrage opportunity?
                          YES --> Exploding Opportunity
                          NO  --> Create a cohort structure to unlock urgency
```

**Critical Rules:**
- Deadlines must be REAL. Fake countdowns destroy credibility.
- The last 4 hours of the last day produce 50-60% of campaign sales.
- If raising prices, always notify prospects before the increase.
- For local businesses, Rolling Seasonal is the #1 strategy.

### 6.3 Bonuses (Increase Perceived Value)

> "A single offer is less valuable than the same offer broken into its component parts and stacked as bonuses."

**The 11 Bonus Bullets (Complete Presentation Framework):**

For EACH bonus in the stack:

1. Always offer them (use the bundled components from Trim & Stack)
2. Give each a special name with a benefit in the title
3. Tell them:
   - (a) How it relates to their issue
   - (b) What it is
   - (c) How you discovered it or what you had to do to create it
   - (d) How it will make their experience faster, easier, or lower effort
4. Provide proof (stat, past client result, or personal experience)
5. Paint a vivid mental image of life AFTER using the bonus
6. Ascribe a price tag and justify it
7. Prefer tools and checklists over additional trainings (lower effort = higher value)
8. Each bonus should address a specific concern/obstacle
9. Solve their NEXT problem before they encounter it
10. Total bonus value should ECLIPSE core offer value
11. Add scarcity and/or urgency to individual bonuses

**Bonus Scarcity Templates:**
- "Only people who sign up for [program] get access to Bonus #1, 2, 3 -- never for sale anywhere else."
- "I have 3 tickets left to my $5,000 event. Buy this program and get one of the last 3 as a bonus."

**Bonus Urgency Template:**
- "If you buy today, I'll add [bonus] that normally costs $[amount], for free. I reward action takers."

**Advanced: Partner Bonuses.**
Get other businesses to contribute their products/services as your bonuses (free marketing for them, high-value additions for you at zero cost). Also negotiate group discounts for customers and referral commissions for yourself.

**Ideal Bonus Types:**
Checklists, tools, swipe files, scripts, templates, recorded workshops, information products. High perceived value, low cost, zero ongoing operational effort.

### 6.4 Guarantees (Reverse Risk)

> "The single greatest objection for any product or service being sold is...risk."
> "Reversing risk is the number one way to increase the conversion of an offer."

**The Guarantee Power Formula:**

```
"If you do not get [X result] in [Y time period], we will [Z]."
```

Without the "or what" (the Z), the guarantee is weak and diluted.

**Four Types of Guarantees:**

**Type 1: Unconditional** -- No questions asked refund.

Options for what client gets:
- (A) Full refund
- (B) 50% refund
- (C) Refund of ad spend and ancillary costs
- (D) You pay for a competitor's program
- (E) Return money plus additional amount

Best script (Jason Fladlien):
> "I'm not asking you to decide yes or no today...I'm asking you to make a fully informed decision, that is all. The only way you can make a fully informed decision is on the inside, not the outside... whether it's 29 min or 29 days from now...if you ain't happy, I ain't happy."

**Type 2: Conditional** -- Guarantee tied to client actions.

| Subtype | What Client Gets | Best For |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| Outsized Refund | 2x-3x money back | High margin products |
| Service Guarantee | Free work until X achieved | **Hormozi's personal favorite** -- never at risk for losing money |
| Modified Service | Extra period of access free | Subscriptions, memberships |
| Credit-Based | Payment as credit toward other services | Upsell processes |
| Personal Service | You work with them 1-on-1 free until X | Strongest guarantee in existence |
| Hotel + Airfare | Reimburse product cost + travel costs | Workshops, events |
| Wage-Payment | Pay their hourly rate if not valuable | High-value consultations |
| Release of Service | Let them out of contract | Contract-based businesses |
| Delayed Second Payment | No second billing until first outcome | Activates fast action |
| First Outcome | You pay their ancillary costs until first result | "If you don't make your first sale in 14 days, we pay your ad spend until you do." |

**Type 3: Anti-Guarantee** -- "All sales are final."

Must include a strong "reason why." Two templates:

Exposure-based:
> "We're going to show you our proprietary process. Our funnels, ads, and metrics. We're exposing the inner workings of our business. As a result, all sales are final."

Screening-based:
> "If you need a guarantee before taking a jump, you are not the type of person we want to work with. We want motivated self-starters. If you are not serious, don't buy it."

**Type 4: Implied Guarantees** -- Performance models.

| Structure | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| Performance | Only pay $X per sale / per show / per result |
| Revshare | X% of top line revenue / profit |
| Ratchets | 10% if over X, 20% if over Y, 30% if over Z |
| Bonuses/Triggers | You get X when Y occurs |

Pair with a minimum: "Greater of $1,000 or 10% of revenue generated."

**Guarantee Type Selection:**

```
START
  |
  What is your fulfillment cost?
  |
  LOW --> How confident in results?
          VERY --> Unconditional (full refund or outsized refund)
          MODERATE --> Conditional + Service Guarantee
          LOW --> Anti-Guarantee (all sales final + reason why)
  |
  HIGH --> Can you tie success to client actions?
           YES --> Conditional Guarantee (conditions = key success actions)
           NO --> Anti-Guarantee OR Implied/Performance model
  |
  ANY --> Can you stack?
          Unconditional 30-day + Conditional 90-day = Maximum power
          Conditional + Conditional (sequential outcomes) = Future-pacing
  |
  STARTING OUT --> Begin with Service Guarantee or Performance Partnership
                   Graduate to less restrictive guarantees as you scale
```

**Guarantee Naming:**
Never use generic names. Name it something creative and memorable.

- Bad: "30 Day Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee"
- Good: "In 30 days, if you wouldn't jump into shark-infested waters to get our product back, we return every dollar."

**Stacking Guarantees:**
- Stack 1: Unconditional 30-day + Conditional triple-your-money 90-day
- Stack 2: Conditional + Conditional with sequential milestones ("$10,000 by 60 days, $30,000 by 90 days")

### 6.5 Naming (M-A-G-I-C Formula)

> "Half-ass naming your product or offering can ruin conversions."

See Section 7 for the full naming framework.

---

## 7. Naming (M-A-G-I-C Formula)

Use 3-5 of these components. Not all are mandatory. Order them for punchiness, not in M-A-G-I-C sequence.

### The Components

**M -- Make a Magnetic "Reason Why"**

Why are they making this offer? What is in it for the prospect?

Examples: Free, 88% Off, Giveaway, Spring, Summer, Back To School, Grand Opening, New Management, Anniversary, Halloween, New Year.

> "Think like a fraternity party planner. The 'reason why' can literally be anything."

**A -- Announce Your Avatar**

Call out the exact person you are looking for -- and who you are NOT looking for.

Rules:
- Be as specific as possible but no more.
- In local markets, go hyper-local (not "Baltimore" but "Towson, MD").

Examples: Bee Cave Dentists, Rolling Hills Moms, Brick & Mortar Businesses, Salon Owners, Brooklyn Busy Executives.

**G -- Give Them a Goal**

Articulate the prospect's dream outcome. Can be a single word, phrase, event, feeling, experience, or measurable result. The more specific and tangible, the better.

Examples: Pain Free, Celebrity Smile, 1st Place, Double Your Profit, First Client, Grand Slam Offer, Little Black Dress, 100K.

**I -- Indicate a Time Interval**

Let people know the duration. CAUTION: Do NOT pair with quantifiable claims on ad platforms (compliance risk).

### Naming Enhancements

**Rhyming:** Good rhymes stick. "Six-Pack Fast Track," "5-Day Book Print Sprint," "Marriage Thrive Deep Dive." Do not force it.

**Alliteration:** All or most words start with the same letter/sound. "Make Money Masterclass," "Big Booty Bootcamp," "Debt Detox," "Life Coach Liftoff." Do not force it.

### Sub-Item and Bonus Naming

Apply the M-A-G-I-C formula to EACH item in your value stack and each bonus. This automatically enhances the perceived value simply through how things are named.

### Offer Fatigue and Variation

When offers fatigue, change in order from lightest to heaviest:

| Priority | What to Change | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Creative (images, videos) | New ad images, same offer |
| 2 | Body copy | New angles, same structure |
| 3 | Headline / wrapper | "Lean Challenge" to "Tone Challenge" |
| 4 | Duration | 6-week to 4-week |
| 5 | Enhancer (free/discount component) | Free consultation to free audit |
| 6 | Monetization structure (LAST RESORT) | Change the offer itself |

> "Once you've monetized an offer, rarely should you change it. Just rinse and repeat."

### Testing Names

Generate 5-10 name variants. Run 2-3 best in advertising. Note the winner. Test new names against the control.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

These are failure modes. Violate any and the offer collapses.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| AP-01 | **Copy competitor pricing** | Those competitors are dead broke. Copying their pricing copies their failure. |
| AP-02 | **Race to the bottom on price** | You can only go to $0. You can go infinitely high. Lowering price is a one-way road to destruction. |
| AP-03 | **Niche-hop** | Switching niches resets all progress. You will fail until you succeed -- failing longer if you keep switching. |
| AP-04 | **Sell to people without purchasing power** | Pain without money = zero revenue. (The resume writer targeting unemployed people.) |
| AP-05 | **Sell to a shrinking market** | No offer can save a dying market. Same entrepreneur, different market = millions. |
| AP-06 | **Focus only on dream outcome claims** | Anyone can make a promise. Bigger claims are easy and lazy. Compete on the bottom of the Value Equation. |
| AP-07 | **Get romantic about solution methods** | Refusing to solve a problem because you dislike the solution. Every unsolved objection is a lost sale. |
| AP-08 | **Charge more than value delivered** | Charge far more than cost of fulfillment (up to 100x), but never more than the value the customer perceives. |
| AP-09 | **Personalize offer failure** | If your offer doesn't work, it means your offer sucks. Not you. Big difference. |
| AP-10 | **Optimize before cash flow** | Over-deliver first. Get cash flowing. Then optimize operations. |
| AP-11 | **Use fake scarcity or urgency** | Fake countdown timers destroy credibility. You look like every other wannabe marketer. |
| AP-12 | **Satisfy all demand at once** | This kills future demand. Each successive launch gets weaker. Keep supply under demand. |
| AP-13 | **Discount the main offer** | Teaches customers prices are negotiable. Add bonuses instead. |
| AP-14 | **State guarantee without "or what"** | "We guarantee results" with no specifics sounds weak and diluted. |
| AP-15 | **Use guarantee to cover poor product** | Guarantees are enhancers, not band-aids. Poor product + strong guarantee = massive refunds. |
| AP-16 | **Pair quantifiable claims + time on ad platforms** | "$10,000 in 10 days" implies a guarantee. Most platforms will reject this. |
| AP-17 | **Force rhyming or alliteration** | Nice-to-have, never must-have. Forced wordplay sounds amateur. |
| AP-18 | **Change core offer when only wrapper needs changing** | Follow the variation hierarchy. Change creative and copy first, core offer last. |
| AP-19 | **Assume offer is fatigued after one exposure** | Most people don't notice an offer on first mention. Offers last years; creative lasts weeks. |
| AP-20 | **Offer additional trainings as bonuses** | Tools and checklists beat trainings. Lower effort + lower time = higher perceived value. |

## 9. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Build the offer BEFORE writing copy.** The offer is the starting point of any transaction. Do not write until the Grand Slam Offer structure (Section 5) is complete.

2. **Make the prospect feel understood, not educated.** Articulate their pain accurately. The pain is the pitch. If they feel understood, they will almost always buy.

3. **Sell the destination, never the vehicle.** Describe what their life looks like AFTER. Never lead with the process, membership, method, or mechanism.

4. **Frame every benefit as status gained.** Show how others will perceive the prospect's achievement. "Your golf buddies' jaws will drop."

5. **Present total value dramatically exceeding price.** Each bundle item gets a sexy name, a dollar value, and a justification. Total value must dwarf the actual price.

6. **Include the "or what" in every guarantee.** "If you do not get [X] in [Y], we will [Z]." No exceptions.

7. **Never discount. Always add bonuses.** Discounting trains customers that prices are negotiable and puts you in a position of weakness.

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

8. **Address the bottom of the Value Equation.** Time Delay and Effort/Sacrifice differentiation is harder to copy and more valuable than dream outcome claims.

9. **Include fast wins.** Create early emotional reinforcement as close to purchase as possible. People who experience a victory early are more likely to continue.

10. **Apply all five enhancement layers.** Scarcity, urgency, bonuses, guarantees, and naming -- in that order. Each compounds the others.

11. **Use the conviction close pattern.** "If I [specific outcome], would you pay $[price]? And what if you only had to [effort]? And it took [time]? And you didn't pay until [risk reversal]?"

12. **Name everything with M-A-G-I-C.** Core offer, sub-items, bonuses, and guarantees all get benefit-rich names.

13. **Stack guarantees when possible.** Unconditional + conditional creates maximum conversion power.

### NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable)

14. **Seek partner bonuses.** Other businesses' products as your bonuses = zero cost, high value, potential revenue stream.

15. **Use the 10x/1-10th test.** For each deliverable, ask what you would provide at 10x the price and how you would add value at 1/10th the price.

16. **Create one-time-creation, infinite-delivery assets.** Excel tools, templates, systems that cost once to build but deliver unlimited value.

## 10. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing any offer copy, verify ALL twelve:

1. **Value Equation Audit:** Score each of the four drivers (Dream Outcome, Likelihood, Time Delay, Effort) 1-10. If any score below 5, rewrite that section.

2. **Comparison Test:** Could a prospect say "this is the same as [competitor] but cheaper/more expensive"? If yes, the offer has failed -- restructure until incomparable.

3. **Vacation Test:** Does the copy sell the destination or the plane flight? If it describes processes, memberships, or features instead of outcomes and transformed lives, rewrite.

4. **Pain Articulation Test:** Read the opening. Would the prospect say "that's EXACTLY how I feel"? If not, sharpen the pain language.

5. **Status Frame Test:** Are benefits framed as how others will perceive the prospect? If benefits are purely functional ("you'll lose 20 lbs"), add the status layer ("your friends will ask what changed").

6. **Value Stack Completeness:** Does each bundle item have (a) a sexy name, (b) a benefit statement, (c) an assigned dollar value, and (d) a justification for that value?

7. **Enhancement Stack Audit:** Is scarcity present? Urgency? Bonuses stacked with eclipsing total value? Guarantee with the "or what"? Offer named with M-A-G-I-C?

8. **Objection Sweep:** List every objection a prospect might raise. Is each one solved within the offer? Each unsolved objection is a lost sale.

9. **Fast Win Check:** Is there an early emotional win included? Does the prospect know they are on the right path close to the point of purchase?

10. **Guarantee Power Check:** Does the guarantee follow "If not [X result] in [Y time], we will [Z]"? Is it named creatively? Could you stack a second guarantee for more power?

11. **Pricing Justification:** Is the price dramatically below the stated total value? Does the copy present the full value stack BEFORE revealing the price?

12. **The "Stupid to Say No" Test:** After reading the entire offer, would a rational person in the target market feel genuinely stupid saying no? If not, the offer needs more value, less risk, or both.
