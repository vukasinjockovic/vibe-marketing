# Halbert Direct Response Craft

This skill encodes the operational wisdom of Gary Halbert -- one of the most successful direct response copywriters in history -- as extracted from The Boron Letters. It governs market selection, audience targeting, copy structure, offer construction, and the physical/digital presentation of direct response promotions.

Halbert's core thesis: the starving crowd matters more than the copy. Find the hunger first, serve the meal second, and write in a way that is invisible, personal, and relentlessly specific.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**On demand.** Activate this skill when:
- Writing direct response copy (sales letters, email sequences, landing pages, ads)
- Selecting or evaluating target audiences / mailing lists / ad segments
- Constructing offers, deals, or propositions
- Designing the envelope/subject line/first-contact experience
- Writing copy that must generate a direct, measurable response (purchase, signup, donation)
- Refining existing direct response copy for higher conversion

This skill is NOT for brand awareness campaigns, institutional advertising, or content marketing where no direct response is sought.

---

## 2. Core Philosophy

Five axioms that override all tactical decisions:

### Axiom 1: Market Before Everything
The single most important factor in direct response success is the market -- a group of people who are already starving for what you could sell. Not the copy, not the product, not the price, not the creative.

> "The only advantage I want is A STARVING CROWD!"

Find the hunger first. Serve the meal second. A brilliant ad to the wrong market fails. A mediocre ad to a starving crowd succeeds.

### Axiom 2: Behavior Over Words
People lie about their preferences -- to themselves and to you. They say they prefer premium beer but buy regular. They say they read the Bible but buy the National Enquirer. The only truth is in the transaction data: what they buy, how often, how recently, and how much they paid.

> "Truth can be determined NOT by how people use their mouths, but rather, how they use their wallets."

### Axiom 3: Personal Over Commercial
Everything you create should look personal, not commercial. A personal letter with a snapshot outsold a professional four-color catalog by a factor of thousands. Editorial content gets 5x the readership of advertising. The A-pile always gets opened; the B-pile goes in the trash.

> "YOU CAN DO A BETTER SELLING JOB WHEN AT FIRST IT DOES NOT APPEAR YOU ARE ATTEMPTING TO DO A SALES JOB."

### Axiom 4: Specific Over Vague
Exact numbers, incidental details, and concrete word pictures beat vague claims every time. "77.6% of car owners" beats "most car owners." "Make yourself a bushel of money" beats "dramatically increase your sales volume." The blue bandanna in parentheses makes everything more real.

### Axiom 5: Invisible Craft
The best writing goes unnoticed. If the reader says "that was well written," you failed. The goal is the order, not the compliment. Style that calls attention to itself interferes with selling.

> "If you are writing for applause... you will go home with empty pockets!"

---

## 3. Decision Rules

### DR-01: Market Selection
IF starting a new campaign or product
THEN find the market first, product second. NEVER start with a product and search for buyers.

> "A guy with a new product cannot always find a hot market for that product but a guy who has uncovered a HOT MARKET can always find a product to fill the needs of that market."

### DR-02: Audience Quality -- RFU Hierarchy
IF evaluating audience segments, rank by:
1. **Recency** (most important) -- how recently they purchased something similar
2. **Frequency** -- how often they buy this type of product
3. **Unit of sale** -- how much they spend per transaction

Hotline buyers (30-90 day purchasers) are the hottest available prospects. Your own satisfied customer list is the best list of all.

### DR-03: List Quality Escalation
Apply this ascending filter to any audience:
1. General population (terrible -- too much waste)
2. Demographic filter: high income, profession, etc. (better, still broad)
3. Known mail-order / online buyers in any category (reasonable)
4. Buyers of similar products by mail / online (good)
5. Repeat buyers of similar products (very good)
6. Repeat buyers who paid big money (excellent)
7. All of the above + very recent purchase (best rentable)
8. All of the above + confirmed performing for similar offers (best external)
9. Your own satisfied customer list (best of all)

### DR-04: A-Pile Design
IF creating any first-contact communication (email, letter, DM, ad)
THEN design it to land in the "A-pile" (personal, intriguing, worth opening) not the "B-pile" (obviously commercial, ignorable).

**A-pile signals:** Personal name, no company logo blast, first-class postage (or equivalent digital trust signals), hand-addressed look, no teaser copy, personal salutation, day/date/time stamp.

**B-pile signals:** Company name prominent, bulk rate, teaser copy ("WOW! Exciting news!"), generic salutation ("Dear Friend"), obvious promotional layout.

### DR-05: Attention Grabber Relevance
IF using an attention device (physical object, startling opening, unusual visual)
THEN it MUST tie in naturally with the message. No bait-and-switch. No cheap tricks. The reader must feel the connection makes sense.

> "People resent this kind of fraud. Don't do it."

### DR-06: Customization Maximization
IF you can customize the message to the recipient's name, profession, location, or situation
THEN always do so. The more custom-tailored, the higher the response.

Double customization (profession + location) is more powerful than single. "How L.A. Cardiologists Can Buy California Real Estate With No Money Down" outperforms generic equivalents.

### DR-07: Editorial Disguise
IF placing an ad in a publication or designing a web page
THEN make it look like editorial content, not advertising.

> "In most publications, the editorial content gets 5 times as much readership as the advertising content."

The ideal: your ad looks like a rave review written by an enthusiastic reporter who happens to tell readers how to order.

### DR-08: Proposition + Reason-Why
IF making any special offer, discount, or deal
THEN always provide a believable reason why the deal exists.

The most powerful reason-why: "You are special by virtue of some unique circumstance."
- "Since your name is [X], we have a very limited market..."
- "Since you are one of the world's leading [profession]..."
- "A mutual friend, [Name], said I should write you because..."

### DR-09: Closing Allocation
IF writing a sales letter or ad
THEN devote 20-25% of total copy to closing the sale.

Be surgically specific: tell them where the order button is, what to click, how much to pay, what payment methods to use, and above all -- to do it RIGHT NOW, TODAY.

> "Tell him what he will get if he hurries and tell him what he will lose if he delays."

### DR-10: Product Focus -- Reduce to Win
IF a multi-product offer or catalog is underperforming
THEN reduce to the single best-selling item with a personal message.

The coat-of-arms catalog (70 items) bombed. The brochure (3 items) barely broke even. The personal letter + 1 photo = $40 million.

### DR-11: HALT Guard
IF the writer is Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired
THEN do not write strategic copy or make offer decisions.

Instead: move physically (walk, run, exercise), write to process emotions, then return to creative work once the deck is cleared.

### DR-12: Emotional Turning Points
IF you can reach people at emotional inflection points (new baby, new marriage, new job, new purchase, recent loss, recent promotion)
THEN they are dramatically more responsive to relevant offers.

### DR-13: Winning Formula Replication
IF a promotion succeeds with one audience segment
THEN keep the core structure, customize the specific details for new segments, and roll out.

Keep the first 2/3 the same. Customize the last 1/3 for each profession, location, or situation. Swap the headline and opening. Test, then roll.

## 4. Pre-Writing Checklist

Complete ALL of these before writing a single word of copy.

### Step 1 -- Identify the Starving Crowd
- [ ] What market are you targeting? Define by observable buying behavior, not demographics.
- [ ] What have they already bought? (Type of product, recency, frequency, amount)
- [ ] What is the evidence of hunger? (List sizes, repeating ads, competitor activity)
- [ ] Can you reach them cost-effectively? (List rental, ad targeting, email, direct mail)
- [ ] Are they at an emotional turning point that makes them more receptive?

### Step 2 -- Analyze the Product
- [ ] What is the product? (Pages, words, format, author, credentials)
- [ ] What does it DO for the buyer? (Not what it IS -- what it DOES)
- [ ] List every benefit: financial, emotional, social, physical, temporal
- [ ] What is the ONE dominant benefit? (Highest urgency x widest appeal)
- [ ] Is this paper-and-ink / information / low-fulfillment-cost? (Ideal for DR)

### Step 3 -- Study the Competition
- [ ] Collect competing DM pieces, ads, emails, landing pages (swipe file)
- [ ] Which competitors' promotions run repeatedly? (Repetition = profit)
- [ ] What central selling ideas are they using?
- [ ] What can you do BETTER, more specifically, or more personally?

### Step 4 -- Assemble Research File
- [ ] List cards / audience descriptions
- [ ] Copy of your product
- [ ] Competing promotions (3-5 minimum)
- [ ] Books/sources in the product's domain (3-4 minimum)
- [ ] Exceptional ads from any field (for inspiration)
- [ ] Headline collection / swipe file

### Step 5 -- Nugget Notes
- [ ] Read ALL assembled materials
- [ ] Take fragmented notes: single words, phrases, observations (uncensored)
- [ ] Include: product specs, author facts, buyer benefits, word pictures, emotional reactions
- [ ] Rate each nugget: * (good), ** (better), *** (red hot)
- [ ] PUT IT DOWN. Walk away for 24-48 hours.
- [ ] Wait for the "aha experience" -- the central selling idea

### Step 6 -- Determine Presentation Strategy
- [ ] What is the A-pile format? (Personal letter? Editorial-style ad? Email from a person?)
- [ ] What attention device ties in naturally with the message?
- [ ] What customization is possible? (Name, profession, location, situation)
- [ ] What is the reason-why for the offer?
- [ ] What makes the recipient feel special or uniquely positioned?

## 5. Market and List Selection

### The Starving Crowd Test

Before investing any effort in copy, answer: Is this market demonstrably hungry?

**Evidence of hunger:**
- Large, active mailing lists with recent buyers (check SRDS, ad libraries, audience platforms)
- Ads that run repeatedly in the same publications/channels (repetition = profitability)
- High average unit of sale in the category
- Hotline buyer segments available (30-90 day purchasers)
- Emotional turning points in the audience's life

**Warning signs of a dead market:**
- No repeating ads in the space
- Small or stale mailing lists
- Low average transaction values
- You are starting with a product and looking for buyers (backwards)

### Audience Hierarchy (Best to Worst)

1. Your own satisfied customers (best)
2. Hotline buyers of similar products (30-90 days, high unit of sale, multiple purchases)
3. Recent buyers of similar products
4. Repeat buyers in the general category
5. High-value mail order / online buyers in any category
6. Demographic matches (profession, income, location)
7. General population (worst -- too much waste circulation)

### Key Principle

> "Products are a dime a dozen. They are important, but much less crucial to success than finding a hot market."

---

## 6. The A-Pile System

### Physical Mail

**A-pile (always opened):**
- Plain #10 envelope, no company name
- First-class stamp (preferably large commemorative)
- Handwritten or typed address (no label)
- Return address only (no logo)
- No teaser copy
- Inside: personal salutation, day/date/time, personal tone

**B-pile (often discarded):**
- Company logo on corner card
- Bulk rate indicia
- Cheshire label
- Teaser copy on envelope
- Inside: "Dear Occupant," obvious sales pitch

### Digital Translation

- **Subject line:** Personal and specific, not promotional ("Quick question about your [profession]" not "MASSIVE SALE! 50% OFF!")
- **From name:** A person's name, not a company name
- **Preview text:** Conversational, not salesy
- **Landing pages:** Editorial style, not landing-page-template style
- **Goal:** Be in the spam box of a primary email address rather than the primary box of a spam email address

### The First Impression Rule

The sale/no-sale decision is largely made in the first fraction of a second. If the first impression gives the reader a "lift," they will read looking for reasons to buy. If it looks like junk, they are gone.

> "We unconsciously spend the rest of our so-called decision-making time not really making a decision after all, but instead, searching for justification for the decision we have already made."

Design for the instant lift: crisp, clean, personal, intriguing.

---

## 7. Headline and Opening Craft

### The Headline's Only Job

The headline exists to get the reader to read the second sentence. Period. It does not sell. It does not close. It stops the prospect and compels them forward.

### Attention Grabber Rules

1. **Relevant.** It must tie in naturally with the message.
2. **Intriguing.** It must make the reader wonder what is going on.
3. **Not a cheap trick.** No bait-and-switch ("A Submarine That Flies?" then "No, but our pills...").
4. **Quality attention.** Focused, curious attention -- not irritated attention.

### Grabber Examples That Work

- Dollar bill attached: "I attached this for two reasons. First, to get your attention. Second, [tie-in to message]."
- Baggie of sand: tied to Hawaiian real estate investment
- Japanese penny: tied to a product discovered in Japan
- Mexican peso: tied to a letter about inflation
- Photo of the product: personal, not commercial

### Opening Template

```
[Grabber attached / embedded]

[Day], [Time]
[Date]

Dear [First Name],

I am [doing/sending] [grabber] for two important reasons:

First, what I have to say is [serious/important/urgent]
and I needed to be sure to get your attention.

Second, [natural tie-in between grabber and your message]...

[Transition to interest-building facts]
```

### Customization in Headlines

- Generic: "How To Make Extra Money"
- Single customization: "How Architects Can Make Extra Money"
- Double customization: "How L.A. Architects Can Make Extra Money"
- Triple customization: "Dear Dr. Davidson, Here is a great new way for L.A. doctors of chiropractic to make extra money."

Each layer of customization increases response.

---

## 8. Copy Flow Structure -- AIDA

### A -- Attention (5-10% of copy)

Get focused, quality attention with a relevant device. The reader must think: "What is this? I better read and find out."

Techniques:
- Physical objects attached to letters (coins, photos, samples, sand)
- Startling but relevant opening facts
- Personal details that create intimacy (day/date/time, location, what you are doing)
- A photograph that creates curiosity

### I -- Interest (20-30% of copy)

Feed interesting facts that build the case. Specific numbers, statistics, surprising data. How much money is involved, how many people, what is unique about this opportunity.

Techniques:
- Exact figures: "$156 MILLION DOLLARS"
- Specific counts: "only 117 families with your name in the entire U.S."
- Comparative data: "5,000 average unit of sale"
- Expert facts: research findings, historical data

### D -- Desire (30-40% of copy)

Help the reader "picture with pleasure" the benefits of owning what you sell. Use sensory word pictures.

Techniques:
- **New car:** "Ride in comfort and luxury, impress your friends and family"
- **Nice house:** "Comfort, luxury, and status"
- **Peace of mind:** "No worries about bills or financial emergencies"
- **Vacations:** "Travel the world, go where you want when you want"
- **Opposite sex:** "Money makes you much more attractive"
- **Leisure time:** "Money buys time -- perhaps the best reason of all"

Sensory standards:
- Feel the sand in your toes
- Smell the fresh tang of the salt air
- Drink in the stars with your eyes
- Feel the warm friendly sun on your back
- The soothing bubbling water against your bare skin

Replace every abstract claim with a concrete sensory image.

### A -- Action (20-25% of copy)

Tell the reader EXACTLY what to do. Leave nothing to their imagination.

1. Tell them where the order button/coupon is
2. Tell them to click/fill it out
3. Tell them to enter payment
4. Tell them how much it costs
5. Tell them what payment methods are accepted
6. Tell them to do it RIGHT NOW, TODAY
7. Tell them what they GET if they act now
8. Tell them what they LOSE if they delay
9. Make it as easy as humanly possible (pre-filled forms, one-click, reply envelopes)

---

## 9. Offer Construction

### The Proposition

Every promotion needs a clear "deal" -- the proposition. Common structures:
- Buy one, get one free
- Volume discount
- Early-bird discount
- Risk-free trial
- Membership/subscription model
- Bundle with bonus items

### The Reason-Why

Every deal MUST have a believable explanation for why it exists. Without it, the deal lacks credibility.

**Standard reasons-why:**
- Going out of business
- Overstock / making room for new inventory
- Tax obligation -- must raise cash quickly
- Lost lease -- must liquidate
- Introductory offer to build customer base

**The most powerful reason-why:** "You are special."
- "Since we used your family name for our publicity photos..."
- "Since you are one of the leading [profession] in [location]..."
- "A mutual friend said you were the best judge of..."
- "Did you know there are only [number] people with your last name?"

This approach generated $40 million in the coat-of-arms business.

### The Guilt Close (for appropriate contexts)

If the recipient does NOT want to buy, ask them to write back and tell you they are declining. This triggers guilt and, paradoxically, increases orders -- because a person reaching for pen and paper to write "no" sometimes thinks, "Well, since I've got the pen, I may as well order."

> "If you can get a person who is not going to order to agree, in his mind, to write and tell you he is not going to, then you will get more orders."

---

## 10. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Make it look personal, not commercial.** A-pile, not B-pile. Every element -- envelope, subject line, salutation, layout -- should feel personal and intriguing.

2. **Use an attention device that ties in naturally.** Relevant grabbers only. No cheap tricks. No bait-and-switch.

3. **Follow AIDA.** Attention, Interest, Desire, Action -- in that order, every time.

4. **Be relentlessly specific.** Exact numbers, not vague claims. "77.6% of car owners" not "most car owners." "$37.5 pounds in 31 days" not "lose lots of weight."

5. **Write for money, not applause.** Invisible style. If someone notices your writing, you failed. The goal is the order.

6. **Use short words, short sentences, short paragraphs.** "Get" not "procure." One to three sentences per paragraph online. Double-space between paragraphs.

7. **Provide a reason-why for every deal.** No unexplained discounts. No unjustified claims.

8. **Hide the pitch until the reader is sold.** The order form, pricing, and commercial intent should not be visible until after the desire-building copy has been read.

9. **Close with surgical specificity.** Tell them exactly what to do, step by step, RIGHT NOW.

10. **Devote 20-25% of copy to closing.** Never rush or abbreviate the close.

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

11. **Customize everything possible.** Name, profession, location, situation. Each layer of customization increases response.

12. **Use transition words to maintain flow.** "Well," "Now," "And so," "Onward," "Here's the thing" -- these bridge sentences and keep the reader moving.

13. **Ask questions and answer them yourself.** "Can you imagine that? I know it seems unbelievable but facts are facts!"

14. **Use parenthetical asides for eye relief and intimacy.** "(it's the blue one)" draws the reader closer and makes everything more believable.

15. **Include day/date/time for immediacy.** Time-dated communication carries more weight.

16. **Describe your physical context.** Where you are, what you are doing -- this bonds writer and reader.

17. **Use word pictures for every benefit.** If the reader cannot see, feel, smell, hear, or taste it, rewrite it.

18. **Include a "(over)" or "next" directive.** Lead the reader by the hand. Tell them what to do at every page break.

### CRAFT-LEVEL (For refinement)

19. **Read the finished copy out loud.** Rewrite any place you stumble. Keep reading aloud and rewriting until the copy is completely smooth.

20. **Hand-copy winning ads.** The physical act of handwriting great copy imprints the flow, structure, and rhythm into your nervous system.

21. **Use the nugget notes method.** Fragment-capture during research, star-rate, rest for 24-48 hours, then write from the "aha."

22. **Match layout to publication style.** Ads should look like editorial content of the publication they appear in.

23. **Use red for emphasis color.** If using a second color in letters, red is the standard.

24. **Use serif typefaces for letters.** More personal, more readable, more editorial.

25. **Use large colorful stamps (or equivalent trust signals).** Visual quality signals matter.

---

## 11. Anti-Patterns

These are failure modes. Violating any of them degrades or kills response.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| AP-01 | **Product-first thinking** | Starting with a product and searching for buyers. This is backwards. Find the starving crowd first. |
| AP-02 | **Trusting stated preferences** | Believing surveys, questionnaires, or what people say they want instead of observing what they actually buy. |
| AP-03 | **B-pile design** | Making the communication obviously commercial: teaser copy, bulk rate, company logos, generic salutation. Half the audience never opens it. |
| AP-04 | **Irrelevant attention grabbers** | Using shocking or misleading devices that don't connect to the message. "A Submarine That Flies?" Generates anger, not orders. |
| AP-05 | **Forbidding layout** | Long sentences, long paragraphs, narrow margins, small type, no white space. The reader decides not to read before reading a word. |
| AP-06 | **Writing for applause** | Trying to sound clever, literary, or "well written." Style that calls attention to itself kills the sale. |
| AP-07 | **Premature pitch reveal** | Showing the order card, pricing, or commercial intent before the reader has been through the desire-building copy. |
| AP-08 | **Deals without reason-why** | Offering discounts or special deals without a believable explanation. Destroys credibility. |
| AP-09 | **Vague, abstract language** | Corporate phrasing like "dramatically increase your sales volume" instead of concrete imagery like "make yourself a bushel of money." |
| AP-10 | **Too many products** | Offering a catalog of 70 items when a single focused item with a personal message would convert thousands of times better. |
| AP-11 | **Deciding while HALT** | Writing, strategizing, or making offers while Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired. |
| AP-12 | **Waiting for inspiration** | Sitting idle instead of moving, writing, and letting the process generate the breakthrough. Movement is the cure. |
| AP-13 | **Letting clients control copy** | Allowing the client to rewrite or override the copywriter's decisions. This consistently produces failed ads. |
| AP-14 | **Weak closing** | Rushing through the action section, being vague about how to order, or failing to create urgency. |
| AP-15 | **Ignoring your own customer list** | Renting expensive external lists while neglecting the most responsive audience you already have: people who already bought from you. |

---

## 12. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify ALL of these before the copy ships.

### Check 1: A-Pile Test
Does this look personal or commercial? Would the recipient open this before or after their personal mail? If B-pile, redesign the envelope/subject line/first-contact.

### Check 2: Relevance Audit
Does the attention device (if any) tie in naturally with the message? Could a reader feel tricked? If so, change or remove it.

### Check 3: AIDA Flow
Is there a clear Attention -> Interest -> Desire -> Action progression? Is each section present and substantial? Is the Action section 20-25% of total copy?

### Check 4: Specificity Scan
Find every vague claim. Replace with exact numbers, specific details, or concrete sensory images. "Most" becomes "77.6%." "A lot of money" becomes "a bushel of money" or "$58,200 per month."

### Check 5: Reason-Why Check
Is there a believable explanation for every deal, discount, or special offer? Does the recipient feel uniquely positioned, or generically targeted?

### Check 6: Word Picture Test
For every benefit claimed, can the reader see it, feel it, smell it, taste it, or touch it? If any benefit is abstract, rewrite with sensory language.

### Check 7: Read Aloud Test
Read the entire piece aloud. Rewrite every place you stumble, pause, or lose the flow. Repeat until the copy reads completely smooth with no bumps or bubbles.

### Check 8: Eye Relief Audit
Are paragraphs short (1-3 sentences online)? Are margins wide? Is there white space? Are there parenthetical asides, transition words, and "(over)"/"next" directives? Would a stranger look at this and feel invited to read, or forbidding?

### Check 9: Close Completeness
Does the closing tell the reader EXACTLY what to do, step by step? Is urgency created? Does the reader know what they get by acting now AND what they lose by delaying? Is ordering as easy as physically possible?

### Check 10: Invisibility Test
Does any sentence call attention to itself as "writing"? Does any phrase sound like advertising copy rather than a personal communication? If so, rewrite until invisible.
