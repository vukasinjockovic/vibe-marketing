# Sugarman Copywriting System

This skill governs the CONSTRUCTION of direct response copy -- how you structure, write, edit, and optimize long-form sales copy, landing pages, emails, and advertisements. It provides the operational framework for building copy that readers cannot stop reading.

**Complementary skill:** Use with `mbook-schwarz-awareness` (which determines WHAT to say based on audience state). This skill determines HOW to say it.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**On-demand.** Activate this skill when writing:
- Long-form sales pages or landing pages
- Direct response advertisements (print, digital, email)
- Product descriptions that need to sell (not just inform)
- Sales emails or email sequences
- Any copy where the goal is to cause the reader to exchange money for a product or service

Before writing, verify:
1. You have sufficient product knowledge (or have been given it in the brief).
2. You know the target prospect's emotional needs, not just demographics.
3. You understand the product's inherent NATURE -- how it should be presented.
4. You have determined whether this is a cure or a preventive (position as cure).

---

## 2. The Core Framework: The Slippery Slide

Everything in Sugarman's system serves one goal: making the reader unable to stop reading until they reach the close.

### 2.1 The Slide Structure

```
HEADLINE
  Purpose: Grab attention, create curiosity, compel reading of subheadline.
  Rule: Keep it short. "Vision Breakthrough." "Pocket CB." "Magic Baloney."
    |
    v
SUBHEADLINE
  Purpose: Expand on headline, compel reading of first sentence.
  Rule: ~16 words. Bridge from headline curiosity to copy entry.
    |
    v
FIRST SENTENCE
  Purpose: Get reader to read second sentence. Nothing else.
  Rule: Make it EXTREMELY short. 5-10 words maximum.
  Examples: "Losing weight is not easy." / "It's you against a computer." /
            "It's easy." / "It had to happen." / "Hats off to IBM."
    |
    v
SECOND SENTENCE
  Purpose: Get reader to read third sentence.
  Rule: Keep it short. Maintain momentum.
    |
    v
FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS
  Purpose: Create the buying environment. Get the reader nodding "yes."
  Rule: Every statement must be truthful and agreeable. No disagreements.
    |
    v
BODY COPY
  Purpose: Logical flow anticipating reader's questions in sequence.
  Rule: Write as if face-to-face. Answer each question as it arises.
    |
    v
CLOSE
  Purpose: Offer summary + satisfaction conviction + urgency + ask for the order.
  Rule: This is where the buying decision happens. Do NOT drop intensity here.
```

### 2.2 Slide Maintenance Rules

1. **Every element exists to get the reader to the first sentence.** Headline, subheadline, photos, captions, logo, layout -- ALL serve this one purpose.

2. **The sole purpose of each sentence is to get the reader to read the next sentence.** No exceptions. No "dead" sentences that only convey information without pulling forward.

3. **If the reader reads 25% of your copy, they will very likely read all of it.** Front-load your best momentum-building techniques.

4. **Seeds of curiosity at paragraph transitions.** When momentum could slow, insert a short forward-pull sentence:
   - "But there's more."
   - "So read on."
   - "But I didn't stop there."
   - "Let me explain."
   - "Now here comes the good part."

5. **Never let the reader say "No."** Every statement in the opening must be truthful, obvious, and agreeable. One disagreement breaks the slide.

### 2.3 The 10 Graphic Elements

All graphic elements exist for ONE purpose: get the reader to the first sentence.

| # | Element | Role in the Slide |
|---|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Headline** | Grab attention and compel reading of subheadline. Keep short: "Vision Breakthrough," "Pocket CB," "Magic Baloney." |
| 2 | **Subheadline** | Bridge from headline curiosity to first sentence. Target ~16 words. |
| 3 | **Photo/Drawing** | Create visual entry point. Must raise curiosity or show product in use. |
| 4 | **Caption** | Most-read element after headline. Must compel reading of copy. |
| 5 | **Copy** | The selling body. Formatted to look inviting, not imposing. |
| 6 | **Paragraph Headings** | Break up visual density. Make copy look less like a wall of text. |
| 7 | **Logo** | Build familiarity and brand recognition. Place consistently. |
| 8 | **Price** | Must be present and clear. Justify if high; explain if suspiciously low. |
| 9 | **Response Device** | Coupon, QR code, button, link. Must be frictionless. |
| 10 | **Overall Layout** | Creates the buying environment. Premium = clean/airy. Bargain = dense/urgent. |

> "All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to do one thing and one thing only: get you to read the first sentence of the copy."

### 2.4 The Three Emotion Principles

These three principles govern word selection and tone throughout all copy:

1. **Every word has an emotion associated with it and tells a story.**
   - "Farmer" evokes honesty, integrity, hard work.
   - "Soviet" sounds more sinister than "Russian."
   - "Cottage" feels warmer than "motel."
   - Changing a single word can alter response by 20%+ (Caples: "fix" vs. "repair").

2. **Every good ad is an emotional outpouring of words, feelings and impressions.**
   - The first draft should be written as pure emotional expression.
   - Grammar, spelling, structure come later in editing.
   - The emotional core must be laid down first.

3. **You sell on emotion, but you justify a purchase with logic.**
   - The reader FEELS the desire first.
   - Then the reader THINKS of reasons to justify the purchase.
   - Provide both: emotional hook first, then rational justification.

---

## 3. The 31 Psychological Triggers

Review ALL 31 triggers for every piece of copy. Select those most relevant to the product, prospect, and situation.

| # | Trigger | When to Use |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Involvement/Ownership** | Let readers mentally "try" the product. Use "imagine," "picture yourself." Involvement devices (quizzes, fill-in-the-blank). |
| 2 | **Honesty** | ALWAYS. The single most important trigger. Admit flaws up front. |
| 3 | **Integrity** | ALWAYS. Reflected in clean layout, truthful message, consistent quality. |
| 4 | **Credibility** | ALWAYS. Establish through brand name, publication context, specifics. Resolve ALL objections. |
| 5 | **Value/Proof of Value** | Educate reader on intrinsic value. Compare to alternatives. |
| 6 | **Justify the Purchase** | Provide logical reasons: savings, health, recognition. "You deserve it." |
| 7 | **Greed** | For bargains and discounts. Too low = credibility risk (justify the low price). |
| 8 | **Authority** | State your expertise. "America's largest single source of..." |
| 9 | **Satisfaction Conviction** | Go BEYOND a trial period. Reader should think: "They must really believe in their product." |
| 10 | **Nature of Product** | Honor the product's inherent personality. Burglar alarm = serious/reliable. Toy = fun. |
| 11 | **Nature of Prospect** | Understand emotional motivations, not just demographics. |
| 12 | **Current Fads** | Capitalize on trends. Recognize when a fad is fading. |
| 13 | **Timing** | Test -- the consumer will tell you if you're early or late. |
| 14 | **Linking** | Connect unknown to known. "The Nose" for smoke detector. "Pocket CB" for walkie-talkie. |
| 15 | **Consistency** | First sale should be simple and small. Then upsell. People act consistently with commitments. |
| 16 | **Harmonize** | Product must match market needs. If it doesn't, change the product or presentation. |
| 17 | **Desire to Belong** | People buy to join the group that owns the product. Mercedes, Marlboro, Volvo. |
| 18 | **Desire to Collect** | Existing buyers are your best prospects for more of the same. |
| 19 | **Curiosity** | The #1 motivator in direct marketing. Don't show too much. Don't tell too much. |
| 20 | **Sense of Urgency** | Place at the END. Must be truthful. Limited editions, price rises, closeouts. |
| 21 | **Fear** | Fear of missing out, fear of loss. Use carefully and honestly. |
| 22 | **Instant Gratification** | Ship fast. Emphasize speed of delivery. |
| 23 | **Exclusivity/Rarity** | Limited editions, small production runs. "Only 6 sold in the entire state." |
| 24 | **Simplicity** | One product, one price, one action. Swiss Army test: 1 model outsold 9 models 3:1. |
| 25 | **Human Relationships** | Use hands holding products, personal bylines, first-person voice, stories. |
| 26 | **Storytelling** | Start with a story. Stories hold attention, create bonds, build environments. |
| 27 | **Mental Engagement** | Don't state everything. Let the reader's mind work to reach conclusions. |
| 28 | **Guilt** | Give value first (information, entertainment). Reader feels obligated to reciprocate. |
| 29 | **Specificity** | "92% of new dentists" beats "dentists everywhere." Exact numbers build credibility. |
| 30 | **Familiarity** | Consistent formats, logos, brand names. An ad as an "old friend" in foreign territory. |
| 31 | **Hope** | For vitamins, creams, golf balls. Do NOT make specific measurable promises. Let testimonials imply. |

## 4. Decision Rules

### DR-01: First Sentence Rule
**IF** starting any piece of copy **THEN** make the first sentence extremely short (5-10 words).
> "Make it short. If you look at many typical JS&A ads, you'll notice that all of my first sentences are so short they almost aren't sentences."

### DR-02: Buying Environment Match
**IF** selling premium/expensive products **THEN** create a clean, refined, confident environment.
**IF** selling discount/bargain products **THEN** create a busy, price-forward, urgent environment.
> "You wouldn't expect to buy an expensive painting from an Army surplus store and you wouldn't expect to find much of a bargain at Tiffany's."

### DR-03: Concept Over Product
**IF** selling any product **THEN** sell the concept (Big Idea, USP, positioning), not the product itself.
**EXCEPT** when the product is so new that the product IS the concept.
> "Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept."

### DR-04: Emotional Sell, Logical Justify
**IF** writing the main body **THEN** lead with emotional appeal.
**IF** the reader is emotionally hooked **THEN** provide logical justification for the purchase.
> "You sell on emotion, but you justify a purchase with logic."

### DR-05: Simple Product / Complex Explanation
**IF** the product is simple and well-understood **THEN** explain it in a complex, detailed way (elevates value).
**IF** the product is complex and unfamiliar **THEN** explain it simply (reduces resistance).
> Schultz made grapefruit complex. Sugarman made computers simple.

### DR-06: Cure Over Prevention
**IF** positioning a product **THEN** emphasize curative aspects over preventive ones.
**IF** the product is purely preventive **THEN** reframe it as a cure.
> "Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive."

### DR-07: Anticipate and Answer Objections
**IF** the reader might object to something **THEN** raise the objection yourself and resolve it.
**IF** you ignore an obvious flaw **THEN** the reader will not buy.
> "If you sense that there might be an objection and you ignore it, it's like ignoring that consumer."

### DR-08: Satisfaction Conviction Design
**IF** closing the ad **THEN** provide a satisfaction conviction that goes BEYOND a normal trial period.
**IF** the reader thinks "They must really believe in their product" **THEN** the conviction is strong enough.
> Testing showed this single element doubled response rates.

### DR-09: Copy Length
**IF** the price is high **THEN** more copy is needed to justify and build value.
**IF** the product is unusual **THEN** more copy is needed to explain and build environment.
**IF** the product is simple and cheap **THEN** short copy suffices.
> "Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the action you request."

### DR-10: Personal Communication
**IF** writing any advertisement **THEN** write as one person to another -- use "I," "you," "me."
**IF** possible **THEN** use a byline to enable first-person voice.

### DR-11: Simplicity of Offer
**IF** presenting an offer **THEN** make it as simple as possible -- one product, one price, one action.
**IF** you must offer choices **THEN** limit them drastically.
> One model outsold nine models by 3:1 ratio.

### DR-12: Specificity Over Generality
**IF** making a claim **THEN** use specific numbers and facts, not vague generalities.
> "92% of new dentists" beats "dentists everywhere."

### DR-13: Hope Product Warning
**IF** selling a hope product (vitamins, creams, golf balls) **THEN** do NOT make specific measurable promises.
**INSTEAD** use testimonials to imply results.
> Making a specific promise that fails destroys credibility permanently.

### DR-14: Mental Engagement
**IF** writing copy **THEN** do not state everything explicitly. Let the reader's mind work.
> "If you make your intentions too obvious, the prospect will feel either patronized or bored."

## 5. Pre-Writing Checklist

Complete ALL steps before writing a single word.

- [ ] **Product expertise:** Have I become a genuine expert? Do I know more than the average buyer?
- [ ] **Prospect knowledge:** Who is the buyer? What are their emotional needs and motivations?
- [ ] **Product nature:** What is the inherent personality of this product? (Serious? Fun? Premium? Practical?)
- [ ] **Cure or preventive?** Position as cure. Emphasize curative aspects.

| 21 | Avoid Saying Too Much | Leave room for mental engagement. Don't over-explain. |
| 22 | Ease of Ordering | Make it ridiculously simple. Remove ALL friction. |
| 23 | Ask for the Order | Explicitly. Never assume the reader knows what to do. |

---

## 7. Copy Construction Process

### Phase 1: Research
1. Study the product until a unique angle emerges.
2. Know the customer -- emotional needs, motivations, what they agree with.
3. Understand the product's inherent NATURE.
4. Determine cure or preventive positioning.
5. Find the CONCEPT -- the Big Idea.

### Phase 2: Draft
1. Write headline: short, curiosity-creating.
2. Write subheadline: ~16 words, compelling bridge.
3. Write first sentence: as short as possible.
4. Write opening paragraphs: buying environment + yes-nodding harmony.
5. Emotional outpouring -- dump ALL thoughts, forget grammar.
6. Flow logically: anticipate questions in natural face-to-face order.
7. Use seeds of curiosity at paragraph transitions.
8. Include technical explanation for authority.
9. Raise and resolve ALL objections.
10. Justify the purchase with logic after emotional hook.
11. Include ALL physical facts.
12. Provide satisfaction conviction near the end.
13. Summarize the offer.
14. Create sense of urgency (truthful).
15. Ask for the order.

### Phase 3: Edit
1. Eliminate "that" constructions where possible.
2. Edit for rhythm -- vary sentence lengths.
3. Combine sentences where possible.
4. Eliminate unnecessary words (target 40% reduction from first draft).
5. Rearrange for emotional-then-logical flow.
6. Check Fog Index (grade 5-8 opening, 8-10 body).
7. Remove ALL cliches.
8. Read aloud for rhythm and flow.

### Phase 4: Incubate
1. Stop. Do something pleasurable.
2. Return with fresh eyes (next day if possible).
3. Edit again.
4. Repeat if time allows.

---

## 8. Editing Rules

The editing process is where good copy becomes great copy.

1. **Eliminate "that":** Most uses of "that" are unnecessary. Cut them.
2. **Rhythm:** Vary sentence lengths. Short. Then medium. Then a longer one that flows and builds. Then short again.
3. **Combine:** Two weak sentences often make one strong sentence.
4. **Cut ruthlessly:** "Express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words."
5. **Reorder:** Move emotional appeals before logical justification.
6. **Read aloud:** If it doesn't flow when spoken, it won't flow when read.
7. **Fog Index:** Check the first 100 words. If above grade 8, simplify. (See formula below.)
8. **Cliche scan:** If you've heard it before in an ad, cut it. "It's the product the world has been waiting for" = death.
9. **Dead sentence check:** Every sentence must sell. If a sentence only conveys information without building desire, proof, or identification, rewrite it.

### The Fog Index Formula

Use this readability check on every piece of copy, especially the opening.

**Steps:**
1. Take a sample of 100-125 words from the copy.
2. Count the number of sentences in the sample.
3. Divide total words by number of sentences = **average sentence length**.
4. Count words with 3 or more syllables (excluding: compound words like "butterfly," proper names, verb forms ending in -ed or -es).
5. Divide long words by total words = **percentage of long words**.
6. Add average sentence length + percentage of long words.
7. Multiply by 0.4 = **grade level**.

**Targets:**
- Opening paragraphs: Grade 5-8 (must be accessible to everyone).
- Body copy: Grade 8-10 (can be slightly more complex).
- Best-selling books average: Grade 8-10.
- Technical sections: Grade 10-12 (acceptable for authority-building).

**Rule:** If the opening scores above grade 8, simplify sentence structure and replace multi-syllable words with shorter alternatives.

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns

These are FAILURE MODES. Violate any and the copy dies.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| AP-01 | **Scare tactics** | Using fear/crime statistics to sell security products repels rather than attracts. Present professionally; let concerned consumers come to you. |
| AP-02 | **Cliches** | "It's the product the world has been waiting for." Signal lazy thinking and fill space without meaning. |
| AP-03 | **Saying too much** | Kills mental engagement. The reader's mind must work to reach conclusions. If you state everything, persuasion dies. |
| AP-04 | **Violating harmony** | One disagreeable statement breaks the entire slide. Every statement must be truthful and agreeable. |
| AP-05 | **Ignoring objections** | "It's like ignoring that consumer." Worse than addressing the flaw directly. |
| AP-06 | **Too many choices** | 9 models vs 1: the single model won 3:1. Confusion = no purchase. |
| AP-07 | **Copying format too closely** | Creates "Echo Ads" that remind people of some other product. |
| AP-08 | **Wrong satisfaction conviction** | Raising an objection and satisfying it with the wrong resolution. Must make sense for the offer. |
| AP-09 | **Dishonesty** | "Try to lie in your copy and you are only deceiving yourself." |
| AP-10 | **Missing physical facts** | Weight, dimensions, limits. "Give readers any excuse not to buy and they won't buy." |
| AP-11 | **Specific claims for hope products** | If the product works on hope (vitamins, creams), do NOT promise specific measurable outcomes. Use testimonials instead. |
| AP-12 | **Long first sentence** | If the first sentence is long, the reader never starts the slide. |
| AP-13 | **Selling in the headline** | The headline's only job is to compel reading the subheadline. Do not try to sell in 10 words. |

---

## 10. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Every element exists to get the reader to the first sentence.** Headline, subheadline, photos, captions -- all serve this one purpose.

2. **First sentence must be extremely short.** 5-10 words. No exceptions.

3. **Never let the reader say "No."** Every opening statement must be truthful and agreeable.

4. **Sell on emotion, justify with logic.** Lead with emotional appeal, then provide rational reasons.

5. **Raise and resolve all objections.** Never ignore a flaw the reader will notice.

6. **Provide a satisfaction conviction, not just a trial period.** Go beyond what's expected. Make them think you're crazy for being so generous.

7. **Write as one person to another.** Use "I," "you," "me." Personal communication always.

8. **Ask for the order.** Explicitly. Never assume.

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

9. **Tell a story.** Stories hold attention, create bonds, and build environments.

10. **Use seeds of curiosity at transitions.** "But there's more." "Let me explain."

11. **Include technical explanation.** Builds authority even for simple products.

12. **Use specific numbers.** "92%" beats "most." "72,000 nerve endings" beats "many nerve endings."

13. **Apply the simple/complex rule.** Simple products get complex treatment. Complex products get simple treatment.

14. **Position as a cure, not a preventive.** Emphasize what it fixes, not what it prevents.

### NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable)

15. **Check the Fog Index.** Grade 5-8 for openings, 8-10 for body copy.

16. **Use involvement devices.** Quizzes, challenges, "imagine yourself" scenarios.

17. **Match the buying environment to the product.** Premium = clean/refined. Bargain = busy/urgent.

---

## 11. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify ALL of these:

1. **First sentence test:** Is it under 10 words? Would someone who has zero interest still read it? If not, shorten.

2. **Slide test:** Read the first 3 paragraphs. Did you want to stop at any point? If yes, that's where the slide breaks. Fix it.

3. **Harmony test:** Read only the opening statements. Is there ANY statement the reader might disagree with? Remove or reframe it.

4. **Objection audit:** List every possible objection to the product. Is each one raised and resolved in the copy? If not, add it.

5. **Curiosity check:** At each paragraph break, is there a seed of curiosity pulling forward? If the reader could comfortably stop reading, add one.

6. **Dead sentence scan:** Does every sentence sell? If a sentence only conveys information without building desire, proof, identification, or curiosity, rewrite or cut it.

7. **Emotion-logic sequence:** Does emotional appeal come BEFORE logical justification? If the copy leads with specs and features, restructure.

8. **Physical facts completeness:** Are ALL dimensions, weights, sizes, and limits included? Any missing fact gives the reader an excuse not to buy.

9. **Satisfaction conviction strength:** Does the guarantee go beyond a standard trial period? Would the reader think "They must really believe in this" or "Are they going to get ripped off?"

10. **Close strength:** Does the close include: (a) offer summary, (b) satisfaction conviction, (c) sense of urgency, (d) explicit ask for the order? If any is missing, add it.

11. **Cliche scan:** Read every sentence. Does any phrase sound like "typical ad copy"? Cut it.

12. **Simplicity check:** Is the offer one product, one price, one action? If there are multiple choices, can they be reduced?
