# Cialdini Influence & Persuasion

This skill governs HOW you make copy persuasive. It provides the psychological weaponry -- seven principles of influence that trigger automatic compliance responses. Every principle exploits a deep-seated human shortcut. Your job is to activate the right shortcuts, ethically, in the right order.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**On demand.** This skill activates when copy needs persuasion enhancement -- when the brief calls for conversion optimization, objection handling, urgency creation, trust building, or behavioral nudges.

When active:
1. Diagnose the PRIMARY BARRIER to conversion (Section 5 Decision Tree).
2. Select 2-3 principles that address that barrier (Section 3 Decision Rules).
3. Stack them in the correct order (Section 8 Stacking Principles).
4. Apply principle-specific techniques (Section 7).
5. Run post-writing quality checks (Section 11).

**Do NOT apply all seven principles to every piece of copy.** Select surgically. Two well-deployed principles outperform seven half-deployed ones.

## 2. The Seven Principles of Influence

### 2.1 Reference Table

| # | Principle | Core Mechanism | Trigger | Best When |
|---|-----------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | **Reciprocity** | We feel obligated to repay what others give us | Gift, favor, concession, free value | Audience is cold; needs warming before the ask |
| 2 | **Liking** | We comply with those we like | Similarity, compliments, familiarity, attractiveness, association | Audience feels no connection to the brand |
| 3 | **Social Proof** | We determine correct behavior by observing what others do | Popularity, testimonials, peer behavior, trending data | Audience is uncertain about the right choice |
| 4 | **Authority** | We defer to those with expertise and legitimate power | Titles, credentials, trustworthiness, weakness-first admission | Audience doesn't trust the offer or the source |
| 5 | **Scarcity** | We value what is rare or diminishing in availability | Limited quantity, deadlines, exclusivity, newly restricted | Audience is procrastinating or lacks urgency |
| 6 | **Commitment/Consistency** | We strive to be consistent with prior commitments | Small initial agreement, public statement, active participation | Audience is interested but not acting |
| 7 | **Unity** | We say yes to those we consider "one of us" | Shared identity, kinship, co-creation, common adversity | Audience is resistant to all marketing |

### 2.2 Principle Details

**Reciprocity** -- People feel obligated to repay what they receive. The gift need not be large; a small, personalized favor triggers disproportionate obligation. Three mechanisms drive it: social training from childhood, internal discomfort of indebtedness, and external shame of being labeled a "taker." Customized gifts amplify the effect -- visitors given yogurt (matching a food need) at a restaurant bought 24% more versus 12% more from a key ring of equal value.

**Liking** -- We comply with people we like, and liking is triggered by five factors: physical attractiveness (grooming, presentation), similarity (shared traits, mirrored language), compliments (genuine praise, trait-based altercasting), familiarity (repeated positive contact), and association (linking to positive things). The halo effect means one positive trait colors judgment of everything else. Joe Girard, the world's greatest car salesman, sent 13,000+ customers "I like you" cards monthly. Everyone knew it was impersonal. It still worked.

**Social Proof** -- When uncertain, people look to what others are doing. Three optimizers: uncertainty (strongest when people don't know what to do), the many (the more doing it, the stronger), and similarity (peer-suasion -- similar others are most compelling). Simply labeling menu items "most popular" at a Beijing restaurant increased sales 13-20%. Costless, ethical, and immediately effective.

**Authority** -- People defer to those with expertise and legitimate power. Credible authority requires BOTH expertise AND trustworthiness. The weakness-first tactic builds trustworthiness: acknowledge a minor shortcoming early, then follow immediately with your strongest point. Domino's admitted past poor pizza quality -- sales and stock price soared. Multiple expert citations beat a single expert.

**Scarcity** -- People assign more value to what is rare or diminishing. Two mechanisms: the quality heuristic (scarce = valuable) and psychological reactance (restricted freedoms are wanted more). Newly scarce items are valued more than items that were always scarce. Competition for scarce resources intensifies desire further. Exclusive information is more persuasive than freely available information.

**Commitment/Consistency** -- After taking a stand, people strive to be consistent with it. Commitments are most powerful when active (written/spoken, not passive), public (visible to others), effortful (required work), voluntary (not coerced), and identity-changing (shifts self-image). Commitments "grow their own legs" -- people generate new reasons to justify them even after the original reason is removed.

**Unity** -- The deepest principle. People say yes to those they consider "one of us." This goes beyond liking -- it is about belonging to the same group. Created through kinship (family, genetic overlap), place (shared home/locality), and acting together (synchronous activity, co-creation, shared suffering, reciprocal exchange). Evolutionary advantage drives it: "we"-groups that favor member welfare increase group survival.

### 2.3 Why Each Principle Works (Mechanism Summary)

Understanding the mechanism helps you deploy the principle correctly.

| Principle | Underlying Mechanism |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Reciprocity** | Social training from childhood creates obligation. Internal discomfort of indebtedness demands relief. The label "taker" is avoided at almost any cost. |
| **Liking** | The halo effect: one positive trait (attractiveness, similarity) colors judgment of ALL other traits. We assign liked people "talent, kindness, honesty, and intelligence" automatically. |
| **Social Proof** | Three forces: validity (if many do it, it must be right), feasibility (if many can do it, I can too), social acceptance (following the majority avoids the pain of independence). |
| **Authority** | Deep socialization from birth: obedience to proper authority is right. Authorities usually DO have superior information. The shortcut works most of the time -- which is why it's so powerful. |
| **Scarcity** | Quality heuristic (scarce = valuable) combined with psychological reactance (restricted freedoms are wanted more). Loss aversion makes potential losses feel twice as heavy as equivalent gains. |
| **Commitment/Consistency** | Three sources: social value (consistency is trusted), practical benefit (reduces decision load), identity alignment (after committing, self-image shifts to match). |
| **Unity** | Evolutionary advantage: "we"-groups favoring member welfare increases group survival. Shared identity triggers automatic, primal loyalty that bypasses rational evaluation. |

## 3. Decision Rules

### DR-01: The Click-Run Principle
**IF** a trigger feature is present **THEN** the corresponding automatic behavior program activates without conscious deliberation. All seven principles work by activating these pre-programmed shortcuts. Your copy's job is to present the right trigger at the right moment.

### DR-02: When to Use Reciprocity
**IF** you want compliance from a cold prospect **THEN** provide value first -- gift, favor, information, or concession -- before making your request. The gift need not be large. A small, personalized favor triggers disproportionate obligation.

### DR-03: Customization Supercharges Reciprocity
**IF** you can match the gift to the recipient's current needs or preferences **THEN** the reciprocity effect amplifies dramatically. Generic gifts work; targeted gifts work far better.

### DR-04: Rejection-Then-Retreat
**IF** you want compliance with a moderate request **THEN** first present a larger request that will be refused, then "retreat" to your real request. The second request appears as a concession, triggering reciprocal concession. WARNING: The first request must not be so extreme as to appear unreasonable, or the tactic backfires. BONUS: Produces greater follow-through AND willingness to agree to future requests.

### DR-05: When to Use Liking
**IF** you want to increase compliance **THEN** establish genuine liking through similarity (shared traits, mirrored language), compliments (genuine praise), familiarity (repeated contact), and association (link to positive things). Use the audience's own words, phrases, and slang.

### DR-06: Compliments That Create Behavior Change
**IF** you want someone to continue a desirable behavior **THEN** compliment the trait behind the behavior, not just the behavior itself. Altercasting -- assign a role via compliment ("You're the kind of person who...") -- and the person acts in accord.

### DR-07: When to Use Social Proof
**IF** the audience is uncertain about the right choice **THEN** social proof is most effective. Show what many similar others are doing. Three optimizers: uncertainty, the many, similarity.

### DR-08: Popularity Labels Beat All Other Labels
**IF** you need to promote an item from a set **THEN** label it "most popular" rather than "specialty" or "recommended." Sales jump 13-20% from the label alone.

### DR-09: Future Social Proof (Trending)
**IF** you lack current widespread popularity **THEN** show honest evidence of growing popularity. People assume trends will continue. Even minority adoption, if growing, can be more persuasive than static majority numbers.

### DR-10: When to Use Authority
**IF** you want immediate compliance **THEN** establish expertise and trustworthiness. The combination is "credible authority." Demonstrate relevant knowledge, credentials, experience -- then build trust by mentioning a weakness or drawback early.

### DR-11: The Weakness-First Trustworthiness Tactic
**IF** your audience is skeptical **THEN** acknowledge a minor shortcoming early, then follow immediately with your strongest point. The admission builds credibility that makes subsequent strengths more believable. Warren Buffett opens annual reports with mistakes. Trial attorneys who admit weaknesses first win more often.

### DR-12: Multiple Authorities Beat One
**IF** you cite expert support **THEN** cite multiple experts rather than just one. Audiences trust the aggregate more than any individual.

### DR-13: When to Use Scarcity
**IF** you want to increase desire for an offer **THEN** honestly communicate its limited availability -- limited number, deadline, exclusive access. Scarcity engages loss aversion. Newly scarce items are valued more than items that were always scarce.

### DR-14: When to Use Commitment/Consistency
**IF** you want lasting behavior change **THEN** get an initial small, voluntary, public commitment. People will act consistently with what they have publicly said or done. Commitments are most powerful when active, public, effortful, voluntary, and identity-changing.

### DR-15: When to Use Unity
**IF** you want deep compliance **THEN** establish shared identity. This is "we"-ness -- not liking (I enjoy your company) but belonging (you are one of us). Created through kinship framing, shared place, and acting together.

### DR-16: Stacking Principles
**IF** multiple principles can be applied simultaneously **THEN** stack them. Combined principles are multiplicative, not additive. The Tupperware party deploys all seven simultaneously -- and it has been one of the most successful sales systems in history.

## 4. Pre-Writing Checklist

Complete ALL steps before writing persuasive copy.

- [ ] **Identify the primary barrier to conversion.** Which of the 7 principles addresses it? Use the Decision Tree (Section 5).
- [ ] **Select 2-3 principles to stack.** One primary, one or two supporting. Check the Stacking Patterns (Section 8).
- [ ] **Gather honest evidence.** Real numbers, genuine testimonials, true scarcity. No fabrication.
- [ ] **Check for Big Mistakes.** Are you accidentally normalizing undesirable behavior? (Anti-Pattern AP-03)
- [ ] **Plan the weakness-first move.** What minor flaw can you acknowledge early to build trust?
- [ ] **Identify the peer group.** Who are the "similar others" for this audience? Social proof from dissimilar others is weak.
- [ ] **Map the commitment ladder.** What small yes leads to the big yes? What micro-action can you request first?
- [ ] **Verify ethical compliance.** Are all claims honest? All scarcity real? All proof genuine? Would you be comfortable if the prospect fully understood the technique being used?

---

## 5. Principle Selection Decision Tree

Use this tree to select which principles to deploy. Start at the top.

```
START: What is the primary barrier to conversion?
  |
  v
Audience doesn't know what to choose?
  YES -> SOCIAL PROOF (show what similar others choose)
  |      + AUTHORITY (expert recommendation)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Audience doesn't trust the offer?
  YES -> AUTHORITY (weakness-first, then credentials)
  |      + SOCIAL PROOF (verified buyer reviews)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Audience feels no connection to the brand?
  YES -> LIKING (similarity, compliments, shared values)
  |      + UNITY (shared identity, "we"-language, co-creation)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Audience is procrastinating / no urgency?
  YES -> SCARCITY (deadlines, limited availability)
  |      + COMMITMENT (get a small yes first)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Audience is interested but not acting?
  YES -> COMMITMENT (foot-in-the-door, get micro-commitment)
  |      + RECIPROCITY (give something first to create obligation)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Audience is resistant / skeptical of all marketing?
  YES -> Lead with UNITY (shared identity) or LIKING (genuine rapport)
  |      Then layer AUTHORITY (credible expert)
  |      Then SOCIAL PROOF (peer-suasion from similar others)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Default: Stack RECIPROCITY (value first) + SOCIAL PROOF + AUTHORITY
```

## 6. The Contrast Principle (Amplifier)

Not one of the seven principles but a powerful amplifier for any of them. Present a higher-priced or worse option first, then the real offer. The real offer looks better by comparison.

- Real-estate agents show bad "setup" properties first.
- Auto dealers negotiate the car price before suggesting options (a $200 stereo feels trivial after a $35,000 car).
- Rejection-then-retreat uses contrast inherently: the second (real) request looks reasonable next to the first.

**When to deploy:** Any time you present pricing, packages, or tiered offers. Always present the most expensive or least attractive option first.

## 7. Principle-Specific Techniques

### 7.1 Reciprocity Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Gift-then-request** | Lead with genuine free value (guide, template, tool, audit) before any CTA. The value must be real -- sham gifts backfire. |
| 2 | **Rejection-then-retreat** | Present a premium offer first. When declined (or as an alternative), present the real offer. Frame it: "If [premium] isn't right for you, consider [standard]..." |
| 3 | **Personalized gift** | Match the freebie to the audience's specific pain point. A "Generic Marketing Guide" is weak; "The SaaS Founder's Churn Reduction Playbook" is strong. |
| 4 | **Uninvited favor** | Deliver value before being asked. Send useful content with no strings attached. The obligation forms regardless of whether the gift was requested. |
| 5 | **Unequal exchange framing** | Show the high value of what they receive versus the small action you ask. "We spent 200 hours building this -- yours for an email address." |

**Copy pattern:** Value delivery -> Pause (let obligation form) -> Request. Never ask and give simultaneously; the gift must precede the ask.

**Rejection-then-retreat in practice:** A boy asked Cialdini to buy $5 circus tickets. Refused. The boy then asked for $1 chocolate bars. Cialdini bought two. In copy, this translates to pricing pages (show the premium plan first, then the standard plan feels reasonable), downsell sequences (prospect declines the main offer, so you offer something smaller), and tiered CTAs ("Not ready for the full program? Start with the free workshop"). The retreat MUST feel like a genuine concession, not a scripted fallback.

### 7.2 Liking Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Similarity mirroring** | Use the audience's own language, jargon, and communication style. If they say "crush it," you say "crush it." If they're formal, be formal. |
| 2 | **Compliment the trait** | Praise the identity behind the behavior: "You're the kind of marketer who..." rather than "You did a good marketing thing." |
| 3 | **Cooperative framing** | Position brand and prospect on the same team against a common challenge. "We're in this together" beats "We sell, you buy." |
| 4 | **Familiarity building** | Repeated positive contact increases liking. Email sequences, content series, and retargeting build familiarity over time. |
| 5 | **Association** | Link the brand/product to things the audience already likes -- causes, communities, cultural touchstones, admired figures. |
| 6 | **Altercasting** | Assign a positive role: "As someone who values quality..." The prospect then acts in accord with the assigned role. |

**Copy pattern:** Mirror -> Compliment -> Collaborate. Establish rapport before selling.

### 7.3 Social Proof Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Popularity labels** | "Most popular," "best-selling," "fastest-growing." Costless, ethical, powerful. Use on the item you want to promote. |
| 2 | **Peer-suasion** | Match testimonials to target demographic. A 25-year-old founder trusts other 25-year-old founders, not Fortune 500 CEOs. Similarity is the multiplier. |
| 3 | **Specific numbers** | "Join 47,392 marketers" beats "Join thousands of marketers." Odd specificity signals accuracy. |
| 4 | **Trending/future proof** | When current numbers are small, show growth: "Growing 40% month-over-month" or "Fastest-growing tool in the category." |
| 5 | **Visible behavior** | Photos, videos, or screenshots of real people using the product. Queues, waitlists, and sold-out indicators. |
| 6 | **Negative social proof (use carefully)** | Optimal review rating is 4.2-4.7 stars. Presence of some negative reviews increases conversion by 67%. Perfect 5.0 scores trigger suspicion. |

**Copy pattern:** Claim -> Prove with numbers -> Prove with similar others -> Show the trend. Layer density, similarity, and momentum.

**CRITICAL WARNING -- The Big Mistake:** NEVER communicate that many people do an undesirable thing. "Too many businesses fail at X" normalizes failure. Instead, frame the desirable behavior: "Top-performing businesses do X." Within the lament "Look at all the people doing this bad thing" lurks the message "Look at all the people doing it."

**Concrete examples of the Big Mistake in copy:**
- BAD: "73% of businesses don't have a content strategy." (Normalizes not having one.)
- GOOD: "The top 27% of businesses use a content strategy to drive 3x more leads."
- BAD: "Most founders ignore their analytics." (Normalizes ignoring analytics.)
- GOOD: "High-growth founders check their analytics dashboard daily."
Always quantify the DESIRED behavior, never the undesired one.

### 7.4 Authority Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Weakness-then-strength** | Admit a minor flaw first, then present the major strength. "We're not the cheapest option -- but our customers stay an average of 4.2 years." |
| 2 | **Credential display** | Titles, certifications, years of experience, notable clients, publication credits. Place near the top, before claims that need trust. |
| 3 | **Multiple expert endorsement** | "Recommended by 3 independent analysts" beats "Recommended by one analyst." Aggregate expertise is more trusted. |
| 4 | **Symbols of authority** | Professional design, quality production, prestigious partnerships. These are processed automatically -- the reader does not consciously evaluate them. |
| 5 | **Being an authority vs. in authority** | Knowledge-based influence is more durable than command-based influence. Demonstrate expertise through teaching, not by demanding compliance. |

**Copy pattern:** Weakness admission -> Credential -> Claim -> Multi-expert validation. Trustworthiness BEFORE expertise.

**The Waiter Vincent Model:** A waiter named Vincent would argue against his own interest by recommending cheaper dishes. This built trust. He then steered wine and dessert choices to expensive items -- and customers followed enthusiastically. In copy, this translates to: recommend AGAINST your most expensive option early ("Honestly, our Enterprise plan is overkill for most teams"), then recommend what you actually want them to buy ("The Growth plan is where 80% of our customers find the sweet spot"). The initial concession makes the recommendation irresistible.

### 7.5 Scarcity Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Limited number** | "Only 12 spots remaining." Must be genuine. Specify the number -- vague scarcity ("limited!") is weak. |
| 2 | **Deadline** | "Offer ends Friday at midnight." Fixed, visible, non-negotiable. Countdown timers that reset destroy trust permanently. |
| 3 | **Exclusive information** | "This data isn't available anywhere else." Information scarcity is even more persuasive than product scarcity. |
| 4 | **Newly scarce** | Something that was available but now is being restricted. "We're closing enrollment" is stronger than "We only have 10 spots" because the loss is fresh. |
| 5 | **Competition** | Show others competing for the same offer. Waitlists, "X people viewing this," auction dynamics. |

**Copy pattern:** Establish value first (via other principles) -> Then introduce the constraint. Scarcity without established value is just pressure selling.

**CRITICAL WARNING:** Scarcity creates emotional arousal that impairs rational thought. If your copy whips up artificial urgency without substance, post-purchase regret and refund rates spike. Every scarcity claim MUST be genuine.

### 7.6 Commitment/Consistency Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Foot-in-the-door** | Start with a trivially easy request (click, watch, sign up for free). Each small yes makes the next larger yes more likely. |
| 2 | **Public commitment** | Get users to declare intentions visibly -- reviews, social shares, profile setup, community posts. Public statements bind. |
| 3 | **Active participation** | Writing, signing, creating -- not passive checkboxes. A typed response creates more commitment than a clicked button. |
| 4 | **Identity labeling** | "You're clearly someone who takes [X] seriously." Once the label is accepted, behavior follows. |
| 5 | **Commitment reminders** | Re-invoke prior commitments: "You signed up because you wanted [X]. Here's the next step." Reminders regenerate and intensify commitment force. |
| 6 | **Effort justification** | When people work for something, they value it more. Application processes, qualification steps, and "earn your way in" positioning increase perceived value. |

**Copy pattern:** Micro-commitment (easy yes) -> Public declaration -> Identity reinforcement -> Larger commitment. Build the ladder step by step.

### 7.7 Unity Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Kinship framing** | Family language: "Welcome to the family," "We look after our own." Use sparingly and only when the community genuinely warrants it. |
| 2 | **Place-based identity** | Shared locality, region, or cultural origin. "Built in [City]" or "Made by [Community] for [Community]." |
| 3 | **Co-creation** | Involve the audience in building something together. Beta programs, feature voting, community-driven roadmaps. Participants become insiders. |
| 4 | **Shared adversity** | Common enemy or shared struggle: "We've all been burned by [industry problem]." Joint suffering creates bonds. |
| 5 | **Reciprocal self-disclosure** | Share something genuine and personal. Vulnerability from the brand invites vulnerability (and loyalty) from the audience. |
| 6 | **Synchronous experience** | Live events, launches, shared moments. Doing something at the same time creates "we"-ness even among strangers. |

**Copy pattern:** Establish shared identity -> Name the shared struggle -> Invite co-creation -> Reinforce "we" throughout. Unity cannot be faked -- if the shared identity is manufactured, the backlash is severe.

---

## 8. Stacking Principles

### 8.1 Why Stack

Combined principles are multiplicative, not additive. The Tupperware party deploys all seven: Reciprocity (gifts before buying), Liking (friend as hostess), Social Proof (each purchase validates), Authority (certified quality), Scarcity (limited offers), Commitment (public testimonials), Unity ("welcome to the family").

### 8.2 Proven Stacking Patterns

**High Trust Stack** (for skeptical audiences):
```
Authority (weakness-first admission)
  -> Social Proof (verified peer testimonials)
    -> Scarcity (genuine deadline)
```
Use when: Trust is the primary barrier. Audience has been burned before.

**Relationship Stack** (for cold audiences):
```
Reciprocity (deliver free value first)
  -> Liking (mirror language, find similarities)
    -> Unity (establish shared identity)
      -> Commitment (small voluntary yes)
```
Use when: Audience has never heard of you. Zero existing relationship.

**Urgency Stack** (for procrastinating audiences):
```
Social Proof (show trending popularity)
  -> Scarcity (limited time or quantity)
    -> Commitment (micro-action to lock in)
```
Use when: Audience wants the product but keeps putting off the decision.

**Premium Stack** (for high-value offers):
```
Authority (expert endorsement, credentials)
  -> Social Proof (selective peer-suasion from aspirational peers)
    -> Scarcity (exclusivity, application-only access)
      -> Unity ("join the elite few")
```
Use when: Selling expensive products/services. Audience needs to feel this is a privilege, not a purchase.

**Conversion Stack** (general-purpose landing page):
```
Reciprocity (value upfront: preview, sample, tool)
  -> Authority (weakness-first, then credentials)
    -> Social Proof (numbers + peer testimonials)
      -> Commitment (free trial, low-friction first step)
        -> Scarcity (genuine deadline or capacity limit)
```
Use when: No dominant barrier -- you need a complete persuasion architecture.

### 8.3 Stacking Rules

1. **Lead with the principle that addresses the primary barrier.** If trust is the issue, Authority leads. If inertia is the issue, Scarcity leads.
2. **Reciprocity works best early.** Give before you ask. Front-load value.
3. **Scarcity works best late.** Establish value before introducing constraints. Scarcity without value is just pressure.
4. **Unity is the deepest layer.** It takes the most time to build but creates the strongest compliance.
5. **Never stack all seven unless the format supports it.** A 100-word email cannot support seven principles. A long-form sales page can. Match density to format.

### 8.4 Format-Specific Stacking Limits

| Format | Max Principles | Recommended Stack |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Tweet / short ad (< 50 words) | 1 | Social Proof OR Scarcity |
| Email subject line | 1 | Scarcity OR Social Proof |
| Email body (short) | 2 | Reciprocity + Scarcity |
| Email body (long / nurture) | 3 | Reciprocity + Authority + Commitment |
| Landing page hero section | 2 | Social Proof + Authority |
| Full landing page | 3-5 | Conversion Stack (see 8.2) |
| Long-form sales page | 5-7 | All principles, layered in sequence |
| Popup / modal | 1-2 | Scarcity + Social Proof |
| Onboarding sequence (multi-step) | All 7 | One per step, building over time |

The constraint is space. Each principle needs at minimum one sentence of genuine evidence. If you cannot provide that evidence within the format's word count, drop the principle.

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns

These are failure modes. Violate any of these and the copy either fails or causes active harm.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong | How to Fix |
|---|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| AP-01 | **Fake social proof** | Counterfeit reviews, manufactured testimonials, paid queues get detected. Trust drops permanently. | Use only genuine proof. Fewer real testimonials beat many fake ones. |
| AP-02 | **Normalizing undesirable behavior** | "X million people fail at Y" means "X million people do Y -- so it's normal." Forest theft sign tripled larceny when showing multiple thieves. | Frame the DESIRABLE behavior: "Top performers do X." Never quantify the bad behavior. |
| AP-03 | **Artificial scarcity** | Countdown timers that reset, "limited" offers that never end, fake "only 3 left" on digital products. Audience discovers the lie and trust is destroyed forever. | Only communicate genuinely limited availability. If it's not scarce, don't say it is. |
| AP-04 | **The scarcity-emotion trap** | Scarcity creates emotional arousal that impairs rational thought. Artificial urgency without substance produces post-purchase regret and refund spikes. | Every scarcity claim must be backed by genuine limitation. |
| AP-05 | **Perfect 5-star reviews** | Optimal review rating is 4.2-4.7. Above that, purchasers become suspicious. Presence of some negative reviews increases conversion by 67%. | Show authentic mixed reviews. Curate for helpfulness, not perfection. |
| AP-06 | **Excessive initial request** | In rejection-then-retreat, if the first request is absurdly extreme, the requester appears to bargain in bad faith. The tactic fails entirely. | First request must be large but reasonable. Not absurd. |
| AP-07 | **Authority without substance** | People respond to authority symbols even without substance, but discovery of fakery produces severe backlash. An actor "playing a doctor" works -- until it doesn't. | Display only genuine expertise. Earned credentials, real experience. |
| AP-08 | **Coerced commitment** | Commitments made under external pressure (threats, massive rewards) do not produce lasting change because they don't alter self-image. | Ensure all commitments are voluntary. Internal motivation drives lasting behavior change. |
| AP-09 | **Manufactured unity** | Corporate "we" language without genuine shared identity increases suspicion. "We" language in ethics codes actually increased lying and cheating. | Unity must be authentic. If you're not genuinely "one of them," don't claim to be. |
| AP-10 | **Hollow liking manipulation** | When people realize undue liking has been manufactured (fake similarities, hollow flattery), they mentally separate the person from the offer. | Find GENUINE commonalities. Real rapport, not performed rapport. |

---

## 10. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Never fabricate social proof.** No fake testimonials, manufactured reviews, or paid queues. One genuine testimonial from a similar peer outweighs twenty fabricated ones. If you don't have social proof, use a different principle.

2. **Never create artificial scarcity.** If it's not genuinely limited, don't say it is. Digital products with infinite inventory cannot be "almost sold out." Countdown timers that reset are the single fastest way to destroy trust permanently.

3. **Give before you ask.** Reciprocity requires that value precedes the request. Never ask and give simultaneously -- the gift must come first, with a genuine pause before the ask. Compliance traps disguised as gifts get detected and backfire.

4. **All authority claims must be genuine.** Display only earned credentials, real experience, and verified endorsements. The weakness-first tactic works BECAUSE the weakness is real -- a fake weakness followed by inflated strengths is just another form of dishonesty.

5. **Select principles surgically, not exhaustively.** Two well-deployed principles outperform seven half-deployed ones. Every principle needs space to work. Match density to format.

6. **Never normalize undesirable behavior.** Within the lament "Look at all the people doing this bad thing" lurks the message "Look at all the people doing it." Always frame the desirable behavior, never quantify the undesirable one.

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

7. **Lead with the principle that matches the primary barrier.** Uncertainty -> Social Proof. Distrust -> Authority. No connection -> Liking/Unity. Procrastination -> Scarcity. Interested but inactive -> Commitment.

8. **Stack scarcity AFTER value.** Scarcity without established value is just pressure selling. Establish why it matters, then show why it's limited.

9. **Use peer-suasion, not generic social proof.** Match testimonials to target demographic precisely. A solo founder trusts other solo founders, not enterprise CTOs.

10. **Build trust with weakness-first.** Acknowledging a minor shortcoming early makes all subsequent claims more believable. Domino's admitted their pizza was bad -- then sales soared.

11. **Make commitment ladders voluntary and progressive.** Each step should feel like the prospect's own choice. Never coerce. Forced commitments don't produce internal change.

12. **Verify the Cialdini test on every piece.** Would you be comfortable if the prospect fully understood the technique being used? If not, don't use it.

### NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable)

13. **Use the contrast principle on all pricing.** Present the most expensive option first. Anchor high, then reveal the real offer.

14. **Deploy trending social proof when current numbers are small.** Growth rate can be more persuasive than absolute size when the trajectory is clear.

15. **Use identity labeling for commitment.** "You're the kind of person who..." creates a self-concept that drives consistent future behavior.

## 11. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify ALL of these:

1. **Principle Audit:** Can you identify at least 2 principles at work in the copy? Can you name the PRIMARY principle and explain why it matches the conversion barrier? If you cannot, the persuasion architecture is missing.

2. **Social Proof Integrity:** Are all testimonials from real people? Are they from SIMILAR others (peer-suasion)? Are popularity claims honest? Is the optimal rating range maintained (4.2-4.7, not perfect 5.0)?

3. **Authority Integrity:** Is expertise relevant to the claim being made? Is trustworthiness established via weakness-first? Are credentials genuine and verifiable?

4. **Scarcity Integrity:** Is every limitation genuine? Will the reader feel manipulated when the deadline passes? Could a returning visitor catch the lie? If yes, remove the scarcity claim entirely.

5. **Commitment Ladder Check:** Does the copy build toward action through progressive steps? Is there a clear, low-friction first step? Is the commitment voluntary, not coerced?

6. **Big Mistake Scan:** Read every sentence that describes a negative behavior or outcome. Does any sentence accidentally normalize that behavior by quantifying how common it is? If so, reframe to highlight the desirable behavior.

7. **Contrast Check:** When presenting pricing or offers, is the most expensive/least attractive option shown first? Is the real offer positioned as the reasonable alternative?

8. **Reciprocity Check:** Does the prospect receive genuine value before being asked for action? Is the value real and useful, or is it a compliance trap?

9. **Unity Authenticity Check:** If "we" language is used, is the shared identity genuine? Would a member of the audience recognize the brand as truly "one of them"?

10. **Stacking Coherence Check:** Do the stacked principles reinforce each other, or do they compete? Is there enough space in the format to support the number of principles deployed?
