# AI Pattern Prevention — Quick Reference

Apply these rules DURING writing. Do not write content that needs fixing later.

## Banned Word List

Never use these unless quoting someone: additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking, renowned, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning, boasts, rich (figurative), profound

## Structural Patterns to Avoid

1. **Puffed-up significance** — Don't add "marking a pivotal moment" or "setting the stage for" or "represents a shift." Just state the fact.
2. **-ing phrase padding** — Don't tack on "highlighting...", "ensuring...", "reflecting...", "contributing to..." at the end of sentences.
3. **Copula avoidance** — Use "is/are" instead of "serves as", "stands as", "marks", "represents", "features", "boasts".
4. **Vague authority** — Don't write "experts say" or "studies show." Name the expert or study, or drop the claim.
5. **Challenge-prospect formula** — Don't write "Despite challenges... continues to thrive." Be specific about what the challenges actually are.
6. **Rule of three** — Avoid listing exactly three adjectives or three examples. Use two, or four, or one.
7. **Em dash overuse** — Max 2 em dashes per 500 words. Prefer commas, colons, or periods.
8. **Formulaic section structure** — Don't repeat the same pattern across sections (intro → explanation → objection → CTA). Vary structure.
9. **Excessive bolding** — Bold only CTAs and critical warnings. Never bold lists of features, benefits, or ingredients.
10. **Title case headings** — Use sentence case for H2/H3. Only H1 gets title case.

## Voice Rules

- Have opinions. React to facts, don't just state them.
- Vary sentence length. Mix short and long.
- Use "you" and "I" naturally.
- Be specific, not vague. Numbers > adjectives.
- One CTA per section max. No stacking.
- No arrow CTAs (→, ->, ►).
- Straight quotes only, never curly.
