# Berger Contagious -- STEPPS for Shareability

This skill governs WHETHER anyone will share your content. It provides the six principles of contagious ideas -- STEPPS -- that determine if a piece of marketing gets talked about, forwarded, screenshot, and retold. Every principle exploits a fundamental driver of human sharing behavior. Your job is to engineer at least 2-3 of them into every piece of content.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**On demand.** This skill activates when content needs shareability engineering -- when the brief calls for virality, word-of-mouth growth, referral mechanics, social amplification, or organic reach.

When active:
1. Score the content draft against all six STEPPS (Section 9 Scoring Diagnostic).
2. Identify which 2-3 principles are strongest for this content type (Section 3 Decision Rules).
3. Apply principle-specific techniques (Section 6).
4. Run the Valuable Virality Test (Section 7).
5. Run post-writing quality checks (Section 10).

**Do NOT force all six principles into every piece of content.** Select based on format, goal, and audience. Two well-engineered principles outperform six half-baked ones.

**The unique question this skill answers:** "Will anyone share this?"

If Cialdini answers "Will they comply?" and StoryBrand answers "Will they understand?", Berger answers "Will they talk about it?" Content that persuades but never spreads dies with the first viewer.

## 2. The Six Principles of Contagious Ideas (STEPPS)

### 2.1 Reference Table

| # | Principle | Core Mechanism | Sharing Driver | Best When |
|---|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Social Currency** | We share things that make us look good | Sharer appears smart, funny, or in-the-know | Launches, exclusives, remarkable facts |
| 2 | **Triggers** | Environmental cues remind us to talk | Top of mind = tip of tongue | Ongoing campaigns, brand association |
| 3 | **Emotion** | High-arousal feelings demand expression | Awe, anger, excitement, anxiety activate sharing | Awareness campaigns, cause marketing |
| 4 | **Public** | Visible behavior gets imitated | Observable = copyable | Product design, social proof signals |
| 5 | **Practical Value** | We share useful information to help others | "News you can use" for someone specific | Educational content, deals, how-to |
| 6 | **Stories** | Narratives carry ideas like Trojan Horses | The brand rides inside an engaging story | Brand narratives, long-form, case studies |

### 2.2 Principle Details

**Social Currency** -- People share things that make them look good, just as they wear designer clothes or drive nice cars. Sharing remarkable information is a form of social spending -- it buys the sharer status, humor, or insider credibility. Three sub-mechanisms drive it: **inner remarkability** (finding the surprising or pattern-breaking element), **game mechanics** (status levels, achievement, competition that people brag about), and **scarcity/exclusivity** (making people feel like insiders who have access others do not). Please Don't Tell, a secret cocktail bar accessed through a phone booth inside a hot dog restaurant, had zero advertising budget and became one of New York's most sought-after reservations -- because the secrecy itself was the social currency. Telling someone about it made YOU the interesting person.

**Triggers** -- Social Currency gets people talking, but Triggers keep them talking. A trigger is an environmental stimulus that reminds people of your product or idea. The critical insight: frequency beats interestingness. Cheerios gets more daily word of mouth than Disney World because Cheerios has a daily trigger (breakfast) while Disney World has a once-every-few-years trigger. Kit Kat linked itself to coffee breaks and sales rose from $300 million to $500 million -- because coffee is consumed multiple times daily, creating constant reminders. Rebecca Black's "Friday" -- widely considered one of the worst songs ever made -- gets a spike in YouTube views every single Friday. The day of the week is the trigger.

**Emotion** -- When we care, we share. But not all emotions drive sharing equally. The critical variable is **arousal**: high-arousal emotions (awe, excitement, humor, anger, anxiety) activate the body and drive sharing, while low-arousal emotions (sadness, contentment) deactivate and suppress sharing. Berger's analysis of 7,000 New York Times articles found awe-inspiring content was 30% more likely to make the Most Emailed list. Angry articles were 34% more likely. Sad articles were 16% LESS likely. Susan Boyle's audition generated 100+ million views in 9 days because the gap between low expectations and extraordinary performance created massive awe. Sadness makes people withdraw. Anger and awe make people share.

**Public** -- If something is built to show, it is built to grow. People imitate what they can see. Apple flipped the laptop logo so it faces observers, not the owner -- turning every open laptop into a billboard. iPod's white headphones were deliberately different from every competitor's black headphones, making iPod ownership visible. Movember raises $174 million because a mustache on your face is impossible to hide -- every "Why are you growing that?" is a word-of-mouth moment. The principle also includes **behavioral residue**: physical traces (wristbands, stickers, tote bags) that persist and advertise long after the initial action. WARNING: making behavior visible can backfire when the behavior is undesirable -- anti-drug campaigns showing how many teens use drugs actually increased drug use by normalizing it.

**Practical Value** -- People share useful information to help others. If Social Currency is about looking good, Practical Value is about being helpful. The chapter draws on Kahneman's prospect theory: people evaluate deals relative to reference points, not in absolute terms. The **Rule of 100**: for items under $100, present discounts as percentages (20% off a $30 item sounds bigger than $6 off); for items over $100, present discounts as dollar amounts ($200 off a $1,000 laptop sounds bigger than 20% off). The **narrow audience paradox**: content aimed at a specific audience gets shared MORE than broad content because people think "I know exactly who needs this" and forward it directly. An 86-year-old man's corn-shucking video got 5+ million views -- pure practical value, packaged simply.

**Stories** -- People do not think in terms of information; they think in terms of narratives. Stories are Trojan Horses that carry brand messages inside engaging narratives. The critical test is **valuable virality**: can someone retell the story without mentioning your brand? If yes, the brand is not integral and you get viral reach with zero brand recall. Subway's Jared (425 lbs to 180 lbs eating subs) cannot be retold without mentioning Subway -- brand integral. GoldenPalace.com paid a man to streak at the Olympics -- everyone retold "a guy streaked at the Olympics" and nobody remembered the casino. In Allport's telephone studies, 70% of story details are lost after 5-6 retellings -- if your brand is a peripheral detail, it will be in the 70% that disappears.

### 2.3 Immediate vs. Ongoing Word of Mouth

| Type | Driven By | Duration | Example |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Immediate WOM** | Social Currency, Emotion, Practical Value | Hours to days after experience | "You have to try this restaurant" |
| **Ongoing WOM** | Triggers | Weeks, months, years | Every coffee break = Kit Kat reminder |

Both matter. Products need initial buzz AND sustained conversation. A brilliant launch with no triggers fades in days. A boring product with daily triggers accumulates massive word of mouth over time.

---

## 3. Decision Rules

### DR-01: The Shareability Threshold
**IF** content scores below 16/30 on the STEPPS diagnostic **THEN** rework before publishing. Content below this threshold will not spread organically regardless of distribution budget.

### DR-02: When to Lead with Social Currency
**IF** the content involves a launch, exclusive, or surprising fact **THEN** Social Currency is the primary driver. Find the inner remarkability -- the thing that breaks expectations -- and lead with it. Ask: "Would someone mention this at a dinner party?"

### DR-03: When to Lead with Triggers
**IF** the goal is sustained word of mouth over weeks or months **THEN** Triggers must be engineered in. Link the brand or message to a frequent environmental cue in the audience's daily life. Frequency beats strength -- a daily trigger on something boring beats a yearly trigger on something exciting.

### DR-04: When to Lead with Emotion
**IF** the goal is rapid, wide sharing (awareness, cause marketing, viral campaign) **THEN** Emotion is the primary driver. Choose HIGH-AROUSAL emotions only (awe, excitement, humor, anger, anxiety). If the content currently evokes sadness, reframe as anger (injustice framing) or awe (overcoming adversity). If it evokes contentment, reframe as awe (reveal hidden complexity).

### DR-05: When to Lead with Public
**IF** the goal is social proof, imitation, or adoption **THEN** Public is the primary driver. Make the behavior visible. Design self-advertising products. Create behavioral residue. Ask: "Can a bystander tell someone is using/supporting this?"

### DR-06: When to Lead with Practical Value
**IF** the goal is targeted sharing to specific people **THEN** Practical Value is the primary driver. Package information as tips, lists, or how-tos. Make the audience narrow enough that someone thinks "I know exactly who needs this." Apply the Rule of 100 to any deal framing.

### DR-07: When to Lead with Stories
**IF** the goal is deep engagement, brand narrative, or long-form content **THEN** Stories is the primary driver. Build a narrative arc (setup, tension, resolution) with the brand as an integral element. Apply the Valuable Virality Test before publishing.

### DR-08: Format Constrains Principle Count
**IF** the format is short (tweet, ad, email subject) **THEN** engineer 1-2 principles maximum. **IF** the format is long (sales page, blog, video) **THEN** engineer 3-4 principles. Only a multi-step sequence (onboarding, email series, launch campaign) can sustain all six.

### DR-09: The Three Whys for Emotional Core
**IF** the content feels emotionally flat **THEN** apply the Three Whys technique. Ask "Why does this matter?" three times to dig from feature-level to feeling-level. Example: accounting software saves time (why?) so you can leave work earlier (why?) so you can be there for your kids' bedtime. Build content around the third why, not the first.

### DR-10: Never Normalize the Undesirable
**IF** the content describes a negative behavior or problem **THEN** never quantify how common the bad behavior is. "73% of businesses don't have a content strategy" normalizes not having one. Flip it: "The top 27% of businesses use a content strategy to drive 3x more leads." Always quantify the DESIRABLE behavior.

## 4. Pre-Writing Checklist

Complete ALL steps before writing shareable content.

- [ ] **Identify the sharing goal.** Do you need immediate sharing (launch buzz), ongoing sharing (sustained WOM), or targeted sharing (forwarded to specific people)?
- [ ] **Select 2-3 primary STEPPS.** Use the Decision Rules (Section 3) and the Content Type Matrix (Section 8).
- [ ] **Find the inner remarkability.** What is surprising, pattern-breaking, or expectation-defying about this? If nothing -- create it (Blendtec asked "Will it blend?" about iPhones).
- [ ] **Identify the trigger habitat.** What environmental cue in the audience's daily life could link to this content? Is it frequent enough (daily > weekly > monthly)?
- [ ] **Check arousal level.** Is the dominant emotion high-arousal (awe, excitement, humor, anger, anxiety) or low-arousal (sadness, contentment)? If low, reframe.
- [ ] **Apply the Valuable Virality Test.** Can someone retell the key message without mentioning the brand? If yes, restructure so the brand is integral.
- [ ] **Apply the Three Whys** to reach the emotional core.
- [ ] **Check for normalization.** Does any sentence accidentally communicate that an undesirable behavior is common?

## 5. Shareability Selection Decision Tree

Use this tree to select which principles to prioritize. Start at the top.

```
START: What is the primary sharing goal?
  |
  v
Need immediate, wide sharing? (launch, viral campaign, awareness)
  YES -> EMOTION (high-arousal: awe or humor) + SOCIAL CURRENCY (remarkable hook)
  |      + STORIES (narrative vehicle)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Need sustained sharing over weeks/months? (brand awareness, product adoption)
  YES -> TRIGGERS (frequent environmental cue) + PUBLIC (observable, self-advertising)
  |      + SOCIAL CURRENCY (ongoing insider feeling)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Need targeted sharing to specific people? (niche product, B2B, educational)
  YES -> PRACTICAL VALUE (useful, narrow audience) + STORIES (embedded lessons)
  |      + SOCIAL CURRENCY (sharer looks helpful/smart)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Need referral/community growth? (membership, community, platform)
  YES -> SOCIAL CURRENCY (exclusivity, game mechanics)
  |      + PUBLIC (behavioral residue: badges, visible membership)
  |      + PRACTICAL VALUE (useful tools/content members can share)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Need to drive purchases? (ecommerce, SaaS, services)
  YES -> PRACTICAL VALUE (deal framing, Rule of 100)
  |      + TRIGGERS (link to purchase occasion)
  |      + EMOTION (awe at value or transformation)
  NO  -> continue
  |
  v
Default: SOCIAL CURRENCY (find the remarkable) + EMOTION (find the feeling)
  + STORIES (carry both in a narrative)
```

## 6. Principle-Specific Techniques

### 6.1 Social Currency Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Inner remarkability** | Find the surprising element and LEAD with it. "A blender that destroys an iPhone" -- not "a powerful motor with 5 speeds." If nothing is remarkable, create the remarkable context (Blendtec created it by blending iPhones). |
| 2 | **Game mechanics** | Build visible status systems: tiers, badges, leaderboards, milestones. People naturally brag about achievements. "I just hit Gold status" is organic word of mouth. |
| 3 | **Scarcity/exclusivity** | Limit access by invitation, time, or quantity. The insider feeling drives sharing -- telling others signals you are in-the-know. Rue La La (flash sales, invitation-only) grew purely through member sharing. |
| 4 | **Secret framing** | Position something as hidden or secret. "If something is supposed to be secret, people might well be more likely to talk about it." Please Don't Tell's secrecy was its primary marketing engine. |
| 5 | **Dinner party test** | Before publishing, ask: "Would someone bring this up unprompted at a dinner party?" If not, the Social Currency is too weak. Find what they WOULD mention. |

**Copy pattern:** Remarkable hook -> Insider feeling -> Make sharing reflect well on the sharer, not the brand.

### 6.2 Trigger Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Habitat mapping** | Map the audience's daily routine: wake up, commute, meals, work breaks, evening. Identify which moments could naturally link to your product. Choose the most frequent one. |
| 2 | **Trigger growing** | Create NEW trigger associations through consistent repetition. Kit Kat paired itself with coffee breaks across all channels until the link was automatic. The association must feel natural, not forced. |
| 3 | **Frequency over strength** | Choose a trigger that occurs daily over one that occurs rarely but strongly. "Weekends are made for Michelob" gives a weekly trigger. "Coffee break = Kit Kat" gives a daily trigger. Daily wins. |
| 4 | **Trigger timing** | Schedule content to arrive at or just before the trigger moment. Morning emails for breakfast products. Friday posts for weekend activities. The trigger must be proximate to the behavior. |
| 5 | **Competitor-free cues** | Look for frequent stimuli no competitor has claimed. First mover advantage: once you own a trigger, it is hard for competitors to break. Kit Kat owned "coffee break + snack" while competitors fought over "snack." |

**Copy pattern:** Identify the daily cue -> Link brand to cue -> Reinforce across channels -> Time content to trigger moment.

### 6.3 Emotion Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **High-arousal selection** | Choose ONLY from: awe, excitement, humor, anger, anxiety. Never lead with sadness or contentment -- they suppress sharing. If the topic is sad, reframe as injustice (anger) or triumph (awe). |
| 2 | **The Three Whys** | Dig from feature to feeling. Functional benefit (why?) -> personal benefit (why?) -> emotional core. Google's "Parisian Love" went from "search engine" to "love story told through searches." |
| 3 | **Awe engineering** | Reveal something the audience did not know was possible. Before/after transformations create awe (Susan Boyle effect: low expectation -> extraordinary result). Science, hidden processes, and scale all generate awe. |
| 4 | **Anger mobilization** | Frame the situation as injustice. Give the audience a clear villain (a company, a practice, a system). Make the victim relatable. Provide an action. United Breaks Guitars: 3+ million views, United's stock dropped 10%. |
| 5 | **Arousal context** | Distribute content during naturally arousing moments: post-workout, post-event, Friday evening, game day. Berger's jogging study: people who exercised were significantly more likely to share ANY content afterward. Physical arousal from any source increases sharing. |

**Copy pattern:** Find the emotional core (Three Whys) -> Select a high-arousal emotion -> Lead with feeling, not features -> Time distribution for arousal context.

### 6.4 Public Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Self-advertising design** | Make the act of using the product visible to non-users. Hotmail's "Get your free e-mail at Hotmail" footer grew them to 8.5 million users in one year. Digital: "Sent via [Product]" signatures, visible badges, sharing prompts. |
| 2 | **Behavioral residue** | Create physical or digital artifacts that persist after the action: wristbands, stickers, profile frames, tote bags, email signatures. Livestrong sold 85 million yellow wristbands -- each one a persistent advertisement. |
| 3 | **Making private public** | Identify private behaviors you want to spread and create public signals for them. Movember makes cancer support visible. "I Voted" stickers make civic participation visible. Voting increased when stickers were available. |
| 4 | **Distinctive visibility** | Choose a visual element that is distinctive and recognizable during use: Apple's white headphones, Louboutin's red soles. The element must be visible on the PUBLIC-facing side, not the user-facing side. |
| 5 | **Avoid observability backfire** | NEVER publicize how common an undesirable behavior is. Signs warning "Please don't take petrified wood" increased theft by implying many people take it. Frame the desirable behavior as the norm. |

**Copy pattern:** Design for visibility during use -> Create persistent artifacts -> Make the distinctive element unmistakable -> Never normalize the bad.

### 6.5 Practical Value Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Rule of 100** | Under $100: use percentage off (20% off sounds bigger than $6 off). Over $100: use dollar amount off ($200 off sounds bigger than 20% off). Whichever number LOOKS bigger wins. |
| 2 | **Reference price anchoring** | Always show the original price next to the sale price. "$100 Now $60" is more powerful than just "$60." The reference point makes the deal visible. |
| 3 | **Restriction signals** | Quantity limits ("limit 2 per customer") and time limits ("today only") increase perceived value. In one study, "Limit 12 per customer" increased Campbell's soup sales from 3.3 to 7 cans per buyer. |
| 4 | **Narrow audience targeting** | Create content for a specific audience, not everyone. "Tax tips for retirees" gets shared MORE than "general tax tips" because people think "my parents need this" and forward directly. |
| 5 | **Package for scanning** | Lists, tips, rules of thumb are more shareable than paragraphs. Clear title that signals value ("7 Ways to..."). One surprising fact as the hook. Actionable takeaway in the first two sentences. |

**Copy pattern:** Frame the deal for maximum impact (Rule of 100) -> Anchor with reference price -> Add restriction signals -> Narrow the audience -> Package as scannable tips.

### 6.6 Stories Techniques

| # | Technique | How to Apply in Copy |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Valuable Virality Test** | Before publishing, retell the story without the brand name. If the story works fine without the brand: REDESIGN. The brand must be integral. You cannot retell the Subway Jared story without saying "Subway." |
| 2 | **Brand as protagonist** | The brand should be the CAUSE of the story's key event, not the backdrop. Jared's transformation was CAUSED by Subway. The GoldenPalace streaker happened AT an event -- the casino was just a sponsor. |
| 3 | **The 30-second retell** | Build stories simple enough to retell in 30 seconds. The telephone effect strips 70% of details after 5-6 retellings. If your brand is a peripheral detail, it will be in the 70% that disappears. Include ONE memorable specific detail. |
| 4 | **Customer transformation formula** | Find a customer with a dramatic before/after. The transformation must be CAUSED by your product. Include specific numbers (425 lbs to 180 lbs, not "a lot of weight"). Let the customer tell it in their own voice. |
| 5 | **Embed other STEPPS** | Use stories as carriers for other principles. A story about discovering a secret bar (Social Currency). A narrative linked to a daily routine (Triggers). An emotional arc building to awe (Emotion). The best stories carry 3+ STEPPS. |

**Copy pattern:** Build narrative arc (setup -> tension -> resolution) -> Weave brand in as cause -> Test with the 30-second retell -> Embed 2+ additional STEPPS -> Run the Valuable Virality Test.

---

## 7. The Valuable Virality Test

This is the single most important quality gate for branded content that aims to spread.

### The Test

1. Write out the story or message you want people to share.
2. Try to retell it without mentioning your brand.
3. Have someone else retell it. Does your brand survive?

### Outcomes

| Result | Diagnosis | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Story collapses without the brand | Brand is integral | Ship it -- you have valuable virality |
| Story works fine without the brand | Brand is incidental | STOP -- redesign so the brand is causal, not decorative |
| Story has no narrative at all | No story present | Build a narrative first, then weave the brand in |

### Examples

| Story | Brand Integral? | Verdict |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| "A guy lost 245 lbs eating Subway sandwiches" | YES -- remove Subway and the story has no mechanism | Valuable virality |
| "A guy streaked at the Olympics" | NO -- works without GoldenPalace.com | Viral, but worthless |
| "Blend an iPhone in a blender" | YES -- the blender IS the story | Valuable virality |
| "A bar hidden in a phone booth inside a hot dog restaurant" | YES -- the secrecy and venue ARE the story | Valuable virality |
| Dove "Evolution" video showing beauty transformation | YES -- Dove's "real beauty" IS the message | Valuable virality |

## 9. STEPPS Scoring Diagnostic

**Use this on every piece of content before publishing.** This is the primary decision tool from the framework.

### Diagnostic Questions

**S -- Social Currency**
1. Does sharing this make the SHARER look smart, funny, or in-the-know?
2. Is there something surprising that defies expectations?
3. Can we use game mechanics (status, achievement, competition)?
4. Does it make people feel like insiders?
5. Would someone bring this up at a dinner party?

**T -- Triggers**
1. What environmental cue in the audience's daily life will remind them of this?
2. Is the trigger frequent (daily is ideal, weekly is acceptable, monthly is weak)?
3. Is the link between trigger and brand strong and unique?
4. Is the trigger close in time to the desired behavior?
5. Can we grow the habitat by creating a new trigger association?

**E -- Emotion**
1. What emotion does this content evoke?
2. Is it HIGH arousal (awe, excitement, humor, anger, anxiety) or LOW arousal (sadness, contentment)?
3. If low arousal, can we reframe? (sadness -> anger via injustice; contentment -> awe via hidden complexity)
4. Have we applied the Three Whys to reach the emotional core?
5. Does it make the audience want to DO something (high arousal) or sit quietly (low arousal)?

**P -- Public**
1. Is the behavior or product visible to others during use?
2. Does using or sharing this leave behavioral residue?
3. Are we making a private behavior public?
4. Is there a distinctive visual element others can recognize?
5. Could observability backfire? (Are we normalizing an undesirable behavior?)

**P -- Practical Value**
1. Does this save people money, time, or effort?
2. Is the deal framed for maximum impact? (Rule of 100, reference pricing)
3. Does it exceed expectations?
4. Is it packaged for easy sharing? (Lists, tips, clear takeaways)
5. Is it narrow enough to trigger "I know exactly who needs this"?

**S -- Stories**
1. Is there a narrative arc? (Setup -> tension -> resolution)
2. Is the brand INTEGRAL to the story? (Valuable Virality Test)
3. Is the story retellable in 30 seconds?
4. Does the story carry at least one other STEPPS principle inside it?
5. Would someone tell this story unprompted?

## 10. Anti-Patterns

These are failure modes. Violate any of these and content either fails to spread or spreads without benefit.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong | How to Fix |
|---|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| AP-01 | **Interesting but forgettable** | High Social Currency, zero Triggers. Generates a spike of sharing, then dies within days. | Link to a daily environmental cue. Give it a trigger that brings it back to mind. |
| AP-02 | **Useful but boring** | High Practical Value, zero Emotion. Gets bookmarked but never shared. | Apply the Three Whys. Find the emotional core. Add awe, surprise, or humor. |
| AP-03 | **Viral but brandless** | High shareability, but brand is incidental to the story. Millions of impressions, zero brand recall. | Run the Valuable Virality Test. Restructure so the brand is integral. |
| AP-04 | **Sad and suppressive** | Low-arousal negative emotion. Content makes people withdraw, not share. | Reframe sadness as anger (injustice) or awe (overcoming adversity). |
| AP-05 | **Normalizing the bad** | Content publicizes how common an undesirable behavior is, making it seem normal. | Flip to quantify the DESIRABLE behavior. "The top 27% do X" not "73% don't do X." |
| AP-06 | **Exclusive but invisible** | High Social Currency via exclusivity, but zero Public visibility. Insiders feel special but nobody else knows. | Add behavioral residue: badges, stickers, visible artifacts that show membership. |
| AP-07 | **Feature dump** | List of product features with zero emotional resonance. Facts don't spread; feelings do. | Three Whys: features -> benefits -> feelings. Lead with the deepest why. |
| AP-08 | **Too broad** | Content aimed at everyone reaches no one. No person thinks "I know who needs this." | Narrow the audience. Specific triggers specific forwarding. |
| AP-09 | **Story without the brand** | Great narrative where the brand can be effortlessly removed. Gets retold without your name. | Make the brand the cause of the key event, not the backdrop. |
| AP-10 | **Forced virality** | Gimmicky "Please share this!" requests or manufactured outrage. Audiences detect and punish inauthenticity. | Engineer genuine STEPPS. Shareability should feel organic, not demanded. |

---

## 11. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Run the STEPPS diagnostic before publishing.** Score every piece of content. If below 16/30, rework. No exceptions for "we need to post something today."

2. **Engineer at least 2 STEPPS principles deliberately.** Accidental shareability is not a strategy. Identify which principles you are deploying and how.

3. **Pass the Valuable Virality Test.** If the story can be retold without the brand, the brand is not integral. Redesign until the brand is the cause, not the backdrop.

4. **Only use high-arousal emotions.** Awe, excitement, humor, anger, anxiety drive sharing. Sadness and contentment suppress it. If the content is sad, reframe it. No exceptions.

5. **Never normalize undesirable behavior.** Never quantify how common a bad behavior is. Always frame the desirable behavior as the norm.

6. **Match principle count to format.** Short format = 1-2 principles. Long format = 3-4. Multi-step sequence = up to all 6. Each principle needs enough space to work.

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

7. **Lead with the principle that matches the sharing goal.** Immediate sharing -> Social Currency + Emotion. Sustained sharing -> Triggers. Targeted sharing -> Practical Value.

8. **Apply the Three Whys to every piece.** Features are not shareable. Feelings are. Dig until you hit the emotional core.

9. **Frequency beats interestingness for triggers.** A daily trigger on something mundane generates more total word of mouth than a yearly trigger on something exciting. Choose the most frequent cue available.

10. **Make the sharer look good, not your brand.** People share to improve their own image. Design content that reflects well on whoever passes it along -- the sharer should look smart, funny, or helpful.

11. **Package practical value for scanning.** Lists, numbered tips, rules of thumb. Clear title. Surprising hook. Actionable first sentences. Nobody shares a wall of text.

12. **Build 30-second retellable stories.** If a story cannot be accurately retold in 30 seconds, it is too complex to spread through word of mouth. Simplify to one memorable detail + one clear narrative arc.

### NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable)

13. **Time content distribution to arousal moments.** Post-workout, post-event, Friday evening, game day. Physical arousal from any source increases sharing behavior.

14. **Create behavioral residue.** Stickers, wristbands, badges, profile frames, email signatures -- artifacts that persist and advertise long after the initial action.

15. **Use the narrow audience paradox.** Content for a specific audience gets shared more broadly than content for everyone, because it triggers specific "I know who needs this" forwarding.

## 12. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify ALL of these:

1. **STEPPS Score:** Does the content score 16+ on the diagnostic? Are at least 2 principles scored 4+? If not, identify the weakest principle and strengthen it.

2. **Valuable Virality Test:** Can someone retell the key message without mentioning the brand? If yes, restructure. The brand must survive retelling.

3. **Arousal Check:** What is the dominant emotion? Is it high-arousal? If the content evokes sadness or contentment, reframe immediately.

4. **Trigger Audit:** Does the content link to a frequent environmental cue? Will the audience be reminded of this tomorrow? Next week? If there is no trigger, the content has a one-day lifespan.

5. **Normalization Scan:** Read every sentence that describes a negative behavior. Does any sentence accidentally make the bad behavior seem common? Flip to positive framing.

6. **Dinner Party Test:** Would someone bring this up unprompted in conversation? If not, the Social Currency is insufficient. Find what IS remarkable and lead with it.

7. **Practical Value Framing:** If deals or value propositions are present, is the Rule of 100 applied? Is a reference price shown? Are restriction signals in place?

8. **Format-Principle Match:** Is the number of principles appropriate for the format length? A tweet cannot carry 6 principles. A sales page can carry 4-5.

9. **Narrow Audience Check:** Is the content narrow enough that someone thinks "I know exactly who needs this"? If it is for everyone, it is for no one.

10. **Story Integrity:** If a narrative is present, is the brand the cause of the key event or just the backdrop? Is it retellable in 30 seconds? Does it carry additional STEPPS inside the narrative?

## 13. Red Flags Checklist

Quick scan before publishing. If any of these appear, fix before shipping.

| Red Flag | Problem | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| "Interesting but forgettable" | High Social Currency, zero Triggers | Add a daily/weekly environmental trigger |
| "Useful but boring" | High Practical Value, zero Emotion | Apply Three Whys to find emotional core |
| "Viral but brandless" | High shareability, brand is incidental | Redesign so brand is integral (Valuable Virality Test) |
| "Emotional but no legs" | High Emotion, zero Triggers | Link emotional content to a recurring cue |
| "Exclusive but invisible" | High Social Currency, zero Public | Add behavioral residue (badges, stickers) |
| "Sad/depressing" | Low-arousal negative emotion | Reframe as anger (injustice) or awe (overcome adversity) |
| "Too broad" | Content for everyone = for no one | Narrow the audience for specific forwarding |
| "Normalizing the bad" | Publicizing prevalence of undesirable behavior | Flip to highlight desirable behavior's prevalence |
| "Feature dump" | Features with zero emotional resonance | Three Whys: features -> benefits -> feelings |
| "Story without the brand" | Great narrative, brand can be removed | Restructure so brand is causal, not decorative |

## 14. Cross-References to Other L3 Skills

This skill sits alongside three other L3 (Persuasion/Narrative) skills. Each answers a different question about the same piece of content.

| Skill | Question It Answers | When to Combine with Berger |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **mbook-cialdini-influence** | "Will they comply?" | Cialdini drives the conversion action (buy, sign up). Berger drives the post-action sharing. Stack Cialdini for the CTA, Berger for the content around it. |
| **mbook-voss-negotiation** | "Will they feel heard?" | Voss builds rapport and defuses resistance. Berger makes the resulting content shareable. Use Voss in customer-facing copy (email, DMs), Berger for the broader campaign. |
| **mbook-miller-storybrand** | "Will they understand?" | StoryBrand clarifies the message. Berger spreads it. Apply StoryBrand to structure the narrative, then engineer STEPPS into the StoryBrand framework for maximum reach. |
| **mbook-berger-contagious** | "Will they share it?" | This skill. The amplification layer. Without this, persuasive and clear content still dies with the first viewer. |

### Recommended Stacking Patterns

**Launch Campaign:**
StoryBrand (clear message structure) -> Berger (Social Currency + Emotion for launch buzz) -> Cialdini (conversion mechanics on the landing page)

**Email Sequence:**
Voss (empathy-first opener) -> Berger (Practical Value + Triggers for forwarding) -> Cialdini (commitment ladder toward the CTA)

**Sales Page:**
StoryBrand (overall narrative structure) -> Cialdini (principle stacking for persuasion) -> Berger (Stories + Social Currency so readers share the page with peers)

**Social Content:**
Berger (STEPPS-first: engineer for sharing) -> StoryBrand (clarity of message within the shareable format) -> Cialdini (micro-commitment CTA)

## 15. Key Quotes

Use these for calibration. They encode the foundational principles.

> "Just as people use money to buy products or services, they use social currency to achieve desired positive impressions among their families, friends, and colleagues."
-- On why people share: it is a form of social spending.

> "Top of mind means tip of tongue."
-- The Triggers principle in five words. Frequency of reminder determines frequency of conversation.

> "When we care, we share."
-- The Emotion principle. But only high-arousal caring. Sadness is caring that suppresses.

> "Making things more observable makes them easier to imitate, which makes them more likely to become popular."
-- The Public principle. Visibility creates self-reinforcing adoption cycles.

> "People don't just value practical information, they share it."
-- Practical Value. Usefulness is itself a sharing motive, independent of social status.

> "People don't think in terms of information. They think in terms of narratives."
-- Why Stories work as carriers. Facts inform. Narratives travel.

> "Can people retell the story without the brand? If so, the idea is not really benefiting from the narrative."
-- The Valuable Virality Test. The single most important quality gate for branded content.

> "Contagious content is like gold. Whatever your product or idea, you'll have to figure out how to mine it. You'll have to find the inherent virality."
-- Virality is not luck. It is engineered.

> "Even boring products can get lots of word of mouth if they happen to be triggered by the right environmental cue."
-- Cheerios beats Disney World. Frequency beats glamour.

> "Rather than harping on features or facts, we need to focus on feelings."
-- The Three Whys technique. Dig from features to the emotional core.
