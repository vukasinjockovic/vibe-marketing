## 1. Schwartz Awareness Model (Eugene Schwartz)

The Schwartz Awareness Model describes five stages of prospect awareness. Each stage requires a fundamentally different marketing approach. This is the PRIMARY framework for audience classification.

### Stage 1: Unaware

**Definition:** The prospect does not know they have a problem. They are not looking for a solution.

**Characteristics:**
- Not searching for anything related to the problem
- Would not self-identify as having this problem
- May exhibit symptoms but not connect them to a solvable issue
- Requires education-first content to create awareness

**Example (fitness):** Someone who is overweight but has accepted it as "just how they are" and has never considered a training program.

**Marketing approach:** Lead with story and identity. "Meet Sarah, who thought she was just getting older..." Do NOT lead with the product.

**Language signals:**
- No problem-related searches
- Identity statements without frustration: "I'm just not a gym person"
- Acceptance language: "That's just how it is"

### Stage 2: Problem Aware

**Definition:** The prospect knows they have a problem but does not know solutions exist.

**Characteristics:**
- Actively frustrated or concerned
- Searching for information about the problem
- Not yet searching for specific solutions
- Open to understanding, not ready to buy

**Example (fitness):** Someone who knows they need to lose weight, feels frustrated about it, but has not looked into specific programs or methods.

**Marketing approach:** Lead with the problem. Agitate it. Show understanding. Then introduce the solution category. "If you've been struggling with..."

**Language signals:**
- Problem-focused searches: "why can't I lose weight"
- Frustration language: "I'm tired of feeling..."
- Self-blame language: "I have no willpower"

### Stage 3: Solution Aware

**Definition:** The prospect knows solutions exist but does not know YOUR specific product.

**Characteristics:**
- Researching options actively
- Comparing approaches (not brands)
- Understands the solution category
- Needs to be convinced your approach is best

**Example (fitness):** Someone comparing "keto vs. counting macros vs. intermittent fasting" but has not settled on a specific program.

**Marketing approach:** Differentiate your mechanism. Explain HOW your solution works and WHY it is different from alternatives they have already considered.

**Language signals:**
- Comparison searches: "keto vs paleo vs macro counting"
- Method-focused questions: "what's the best approach for..."
- Evaluative language: "has anyone tried..."

### Stage 4: Product Aware

**Definition:** The prospect knows your product but has not bought yet.

**Characteristics:**
- Aware of your specific product/brand
- Considering purchase but has objections
- Comparing you to specific competitors
- Needs social proof, guarantees, or offers

**Example (fitness):** Someone who has seen your training program, is on the sales page, but has not clicked buy.

**Marketing approach:** Address specific objections. Provide social proof. Make an irresistible offer. Reduce risk with guarantees.

**Language signals:**
- Brand-specific searches: "[your product] review"
- Objection questions: "is [your product] worth it"
- Comparison: "[your product] vs [competitor]"

### Stage 5: Most Aware

**Definition:** The prospect knows your product and wants it. They just need the right offer or push.

**Characteristics:**
- Past customers, email subscribers, engaged followers
- Already convinced of the value
- Waiting for the right price, timing, or offer
- Needs urgency or a special deal

**Example (fitness):** Someone who bought your beginner program and loved it, now eyeing the advanced program.

**Marketing approach:** Make a direct offer. Use urgency. No need to educate. "Get 30% off this week only."

**Language signals:**
- Direct product searches: "[your product] discount"
- Return visits to pricing page
- Cart abandonment

## 2. Market Sophistication (Eugene Schwartz)

Market sophistication describes how many similar products the audience has been exposed to. This determines messaging complexity.

### Stage 1: First to Market

**The market has never seen a product like this.**

- Make a simple, direct claim
- "Lose 10 pounds in 30 days"
- No proof needed beyond the claim itself
- Extremely rare in modern markets

### Stage 2: Second to Market

**Competitors exist making similar claims.**

- Make a bigger, better, or more specific claim
- "Lose 15 pounds in 21 days"
- Enlarge the claim, add specifics
- Still claim-driven, just louder

### Stage 3: Mechanism Stage

**The market is skeptical of claims.**

- Introduce your unique MECHANISM
- "Lose weight with our patented Metabolic Reset Protocol"
- Explain HOW it works, not just what it does
- The mechanism becomes the differentiator

### Stage 4: Elaborated Mechanism

**Mechanisms are common; market needs specificity.**

- Add proof, specificity, and credibility to your mechanism
- "Our science-backed Metabolic Reset Protocol, validated in a 2024 clinical study of 1,247 participants..."
- Stack evidence: studies, testimonials, expert endorsements

### Stage 5: Exhausted Market

**The market has heard everything.**

- Lead with IDENTITY, not claims
- "For the woman who has tried everything and is ready for something that actually works"
- Tell their story back to them
- Connection > claims

**How to assess sophistication for a focus group:**
1. How many competing products has this group been exposed to?
2. How many marketing messages have they seen?
3. How skeptical are they of claims?
4. What would make them believe a new claim?

## 3. VALS Framework (SRI International)

VALS (Values, Attitudes, and Lifestyles) segments consumers by psychological traits and resources. Useful for understanding motivation orientation.

### Primary Motivation: Ideals (knowledge and principles)

**Thinkers:**
- Mature, responsible, well-educated
- Motivated by ideals and knowledge
- Practical consumers, look for durability and value
- Research before buying, not impulsive
- Respect authority and expertise

**Believers:**
- Conservative, conventional
- Strong principles, family-oriented
- Loyal to established brands
- Predictable consumption patterns
- Skeptical of change, trust tradition

### Primary Motivation: Achievement (success symbols)

**Achievers:**
- Goal-oriented, conventional success
- Deep commitment to career and family
- Image-conscious, favor prestige products
- Time-poor, value convenience
- Influenced by peer success

**Strivers:**
- Want to be achievers but lack resources
- Trendy, fun-loving
- Money defines success for them
- Impulsive buyers, seek approval
- Influenced by celebrity and social proof

### Primary Motivation: Self-Expression (variety and activity)

**Experiencers:**
- Young, enthusiastic, impulsive
- Seek variety and excitement
- Avid consumers, spend on fashion, entertainment, socializing
- Exercise, sports, outdoor recreation
- Early adopters

**Makers:**
- Practical, self-sufficient
- Focused on family, work, physical recreation
- Suspicious of new ideas, respectful of authority
- Buy basics, value function over style
- DIY mentality

### High/Low Resources

**Innovators (high resources, high motivation):**
- Successful, sophisticated, take-charge
- High self-esteem, wide interests
- Concerned with image as expression of taste and character
- Among the established and emerging leaders
- Wide range of interests

**Survivors (low resources, low motivation):**
- Narrowly focused lives
- Few resources, feel powerless
- Chief concern: security and safety
- Cautious consumers, loyal to brands
- Focus on basic needs

**How to map VALS to focus groups:**
- Is this group motivated by ideals, achievement, or self-expression?
- What resource level do they have (education, income, confidence)?
- This mapping helps predict their buying behavior and media consumption

## 4. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Different audience segments may be motivated by different levels of the hierarchy. Understanding which level drives a segment helps craft resonant messaging.

### Level 1: Physiological Needs

**Motivation:** Basic survival -- food, water, shelter, health

**In marketing context:**
- Health-related products address this directly
- "Survive" messaging
- Urgent, fear-driven
- Example: "Prevent diabetes with proper nutrition"

### Level 2: Safety Needs

**Motivation:** Security, stability, protection from harm

**In marketing context:**
- Insurance, security, financial products
- Risk-aversion messaging
- Guarantee-heavy, trust-building
- Example: "Protect your family's financial future"

### Level 3: Love and Belonging

**Motivation:** Connection, relationships, community

**In marketing context:**
- Community-building, social products
- "You're not alone" messaging
- Testimonials, user stories, group identity
- Example: "Join 50,000 people who transformed together"

### Level 4: Esteem Needs

**Motivation:** Achievement, recognition, respect, status

**In marketing context:**
- Premium products, certifications, achievements
- Status and accomplishment messaging
- Before/after transformations, success stories
- Example: "Finally get the recognition you deserve"

### Level 5: Self-Actualization

**Motivation:** Reaching full potential, creativity, purpose

**In marketing context:**
- High-end coaching, mastery programs
- "Become the best version of yourself" messaging
- Authenticity and purpose-driven content
- Example: "Unlock your true potential"

**How to map Maslow to focus groups:**
- What is the DEEPEST need this group is trying to fulfill?
- Someone buying a fitness program might be at Level 2 (health fear), Level 3 (wanting to fit in), Level 4 (wanting to look impressive), or Level 5 (mastering their body)
- The same product serves different Maslow levels for different segments
- This determines the emotional core of your messaging

## Applying Frameworks to Focus Groups

When building a focus group profile, use these frameworks as lenses:

1. **Schwartz Awareness**: What awareness stage is this group at? This determines the MESSAGE TYPE.
2. **Market Sophistication**: How skeptical is this group? This determines the PROOF LEVEL.
3. **VALS**: What motivates this group? This determines the APPEAL TYPE.
4. **Maslow**: What need level drives them? This determines the EMOTIONAL CORE.

Record these assessments in the focus group's enrichment fields:
- `awarenessStage` + `awarenessConfidence` + `awarenessSignals`
- `sophisticationLevel`
- The VALS and Maslow assessments go into `researchNotes`
