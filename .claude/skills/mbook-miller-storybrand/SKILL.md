# StoryBrand SB7 Narrative Structure

This skill structures ALL marketing copy using the seven elements of story. When active, every piece of content must position the customer as the hero and the brand as the guide. No exceptions.

---

## 1. When Active

This skill activates when:
- Writing any marketing copy that tells a brand's story (landing pages, emails, ads, scripts)
- Creating or editing a BrandScript
- Structuring a messaging campaign
- Reviewing existing copy for narrative clarity
- The brief mentions "StoryBrand," "SB7," "BrandScript," "narrative structure," or "story-based messaging"

Before writing, determine:
1. Has a BrandScript been created for this brand/product? If not, create one first.
2. Does every sentence trace back to one of the seven SB7 elements? If not, cut it.
3. Can a caveman grunt the message back? (The Grunt Test.) If not, simplify.

---

## 2. The SB7 Framework

> "A character who wants something encounters a problem before they can get it. At the peak of their despair, a guide steps into their lives, gives them a plan, and calls them to action. That action helps them avoid failure and experience a success."

### 2.1 Element 1: A CHARACTER (The Customer)

The customer is the hero. The brand is NEVER the hero.

**What to define:** ONE thing the customer wants, stated simply.

**Survival connection required.** The desire must tie to one of these:
| Survival Category | Example |
|---|---|
| Conserving financial resources | "Save Money. Live Better." (Walmart) |
| Conserving time | Full Focus Planner, housecleaning services |
| Building social networks | Communities, churches, coaching groups |
| Gaining status | Mercedes, Rolex, luxury brands |
| Accumulating resources | Financial advisers, B2B productivity tools |
| Showing generosity | TOMS Shoes, NFL charitable associations |
| Desiring meaning | Patagonia, cause-driven brands |

**Rules:**
- ONE desire per BrandScript. Multiple desires = confusion.
- State it in plain language. No jargon. No insider terms.
- If someone can't understand the desire in 5 seconds, it's too complex.

**Test:** "Could a hitchhiker understand where you're taking them before they get in the car?"

**Examples:**
- Financial Adviser: "A Plan for Your Retirement"
- Fine-Dining Restaurant: "A Meal Everybody Will Remember"
- Real Estate Agent: "The Home You've Dreamed About"
- Landscaping Company: "A Yard That Looks Better Than Your Neighbor's"

### 2.2 Element 2: HAS A PROBLEM

Problems deepen interest. The more you talk about problems, the more customers engage.

**Four components:**

**VILLAIN:** The root source of the customer's conflict.
- Must be a root source (not a symptom)
- Must be relatable (customers disdain it immediately)
- Must be singular (one villain, not five)
- Must be real (no fearmongering)

| Brand | Villain |
|---|---|
| Tesla | Gas-guzzling, inferior technology |
| Nespresso | Coffee machines that make bad coffee |
| Edward Jones | Financial firms that don't listen |
| Time-management software | "Time thieves" |

**EXTERNAL PROBLEM:** The tangible, physical problem.
- What the customer literally needs (a car, a meal, clean teeth, a website)

**INTERNAL PROBLEM:** How the external problem makes them FEEL.
- This is the deeper motivator. Most brands miss this entirely.
- "Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but people buy solutions to internal problems."
- Key question: "What does this external problem make our customer feel?"
- Common feelings: frustrated, embarrassed, confused, overwhelmed, intimidated, helpless

**PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM:** Why this situation is simply WRONG.
- Uses "ought" and "shouldn't" language
- "I shouldn't have to be a barista to make gourmet coffee at home."
- "My choice of car ought to help save the environment."
- "Everybody deserves to work for a great manager."

**The Perfect Brand Promise** closes all three in one message:
> "When you brush with Gel Fresh, you get clean teeth without the harmful effects (external) and will feel better about how you're taking care of yourself (internal) because you shouldn't have to compromise your health just to have a great smile (philosophical)."

### 2.3 Element 3: AND MEETS A GUIDE (The Brand)

The brand is the guide. Guides have TWO traits:

**EMPATHY** (establishes trust):
- "We understand how it feels to..."
- "Nobody should have to experience..."
- "Like you, we are frustrated by..."
- Find and express COMMONALITY with the customer

**COMPETENCY** (earns respect):
| Evidence Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Testimonials | 3 short ones. Speak to problem solved. |
| Statistics | "125,000 users trust our software" |
| Awards | Small logos at bottom of page |
| Press mentions | "Featured by [logo]" |
| Client logos | Social proof for B2B |

**Rules:**
- Empathy FIRST, then competency. (Amy Cuddy: "Can I trust?" before "Can I respect?")
- You CAN talk about yourself -- but only the parts that serve the customer's story
- Never position as hero. Never make the story about your transformation.
- Guides are STRONG. No false humility. No self-deprecation about your competency.
- "Mary Poppins does not explain herself to anybody."

### 2.4 Element 4: WHO GIVES THEM A PLAN

Plans remove cognitive dissonance -- the gap between wanting to buy and actually buying.

**PROCESS PLAN (alleviates confusion):**
- 3-6 steps showing how to buy or use the product
- Can be pre-purchase, post-purchase, or both
- Each step = one short sentence

Pre-purchase example:
1. Schedule an appointment
2. Allow us to create a customized plan
3. Let's execute the plan together

Post-purchase example:
1. Download the software
2. Integrate your database
3. Revolutionize your customer interaction

Combined example:
1. Test-drive a car
2. Purchase the car
3. Enjoy free maintenance for life

**AGREEMENT PLAN (alleviates fears):**
- List of promises countering customer concerns
- "You will never have to haggle" (CarMax)
- "Quality certification on every car" (CarMax)
- Works in the background -- doesn't need to be on the homepage

**Name your plan.** Examples:
- "The Easy Installation Plan"
- "Our Quality Guarantee"
- "The World's Best Night's Sleep Plan"

### 2.5 Element 5: AND CALLS THEM TO ACTION

Heroes don't act on their own. They must be challenged.

**DIRECT CTA:**
- "Buy Now" / "Schedule a Call" / "Register Today" / "Add to Cart"
- Must be visually OBVIOUS: different color, brighter than other buttons
- Place at top-right of website AND center of above-fold section
- Repeat as customer scrolls down the page
- Include at end of every email, on signage, in every ad
- Ask a yes/no question: "Would you like to place an order right now?"
- NEVER: "If you're interested, let me know" (passive, confusing)

**TRANSITIONAL CTA:**
- Free PDF, webinar, sample, free trial, video series
- Like asking for a date (vs. proposing marriage)
- Positioned as smaller button NEXT TO direct CTA

**The Relationship Pattern:**
```
Direct: "Will you marry me?" -> No.
Transitional: "Will you go out with me?" -> Yes.
Direct: "Will you marry me now?" -> No.
Transitional: "Will you go out again?" -> Sure.
Direct: "Will you marry me?" -> Okay.
```

**Rule:** Having both direct and transitional CTAs on every page is mandatory. Never stop asking.

### 2.6 Element 6: THAT HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE

Without stakes, there is no story. Without stakes, there is no reason to buy.

**Define 3-4 negative consequences** of NOT buying your product.

**The Fear Appeal (4 steps):**
1. Make the reader know they are VULNERABLE to a threat
2. Let them know they should TAKE ACTION
3. Let them know about a SPECIFIC action that protects them
4. CHALLENGE them to take that action

**Calibration: "Fear is salt in the recipe."**
- Zero fear = no urgency, no action
- Moderate fear = attitude and behavior change (optimal)
- Excessive fear = readers block it out
- Rule of thumb: "When I am slightly uncomfortable with the negativity, I add a little more and then stop."

**Loss aversion is real:** People are 2-3x more motivated to avoid a loss than achieve a gain (Kahneman, 1979).

**Examples:**
| Brand | Negative Stakes |
|---|---|
| Financial Adviser | Not ready for retirement, hidden fees, confusion |
| Used Car Dealer | Getting ripped off, stuck with a lemon, feeling taken advantage of |
| Summer Camp | Long boring summer, restless kids, wasted summer regret |
| Home A/V | Boring home, nobody wants to watch the game at your house |

**Important:** The deeper the hole, the brighter the light at the end. All negativity becomes positivity once overcome.

### 2.7 Element 7: AND ENDS IN A SUCCESS

Tell customers where you're taking them. Be specific.

**Close all three story loops:**
- External resolution: The tangible problem solved
- Internal resolution: How they FEEL now
- Philosophical resolution: Justice restored

**Three resolution archetypes:**

| Archetype | What It Offers | Brand Tactics |
|---|---|---|
| Status / Power | Being more esteemed, respected, appealing | Offer access, scarcity, premium tiers, identity association |
| Completeness / Union | Being made whole by external provision | Reduced anxiety, reduced workload, more time |
| Self-Realization | Reaching potential, accepting self | Inspiration, acceptance, transcendence |

**Be specific:**
- BAD: "We help you succeed"
- GOOD: "A room that finally feels finished" (rugs)
- GOOD: "Always prepared for adventure" (camping gear)
- GOOD: "A rich, creamy taste of heaven" (ice cream)

**Use images:** Show happy people engaging with your product. Smiling faces = closed story loops.

### 2.8 Bonus: Identity Transformation

The deepest motivator: the desire to become someone different.

**Template:** FROM [current identity] -> TO [aspirational identity]

**Key question:** "How does your customer want to be described by others?"

| Brand | From | To |
|---|---|---|
| Pet Food | Passive dog owner | Every dog's hero |
| Financial Adviser | Confused and ill-equipped | Competent and smart |
| Shampoo | Anxious and glum | Carefree and radiant |
| Gerber Knives | Ordinary person | Tough, adventurous, fearless |

**The guide affirms the transformation.** Heroes don't realize they've changed until someone tells them.

### 2.9 Bonus: Controlling Idea

The ONE sentence that captures the moral of the story.

**Requirements:**
- Immediately understood (no explanation needed)
- Repeatable (customers can say it to friends)
- Repeated everywhere: header, email subject, swag, wall art, conversation

**Examples:**
- "Twenty minutes, twice" (MaxStrength Fitness)
- "We Will Make You a Pro in the Kitchen!" (cooking school)
- "Save Money. Live Better." (Walmart)
- "Might as well have the best" (Filson)
- "Debt is dumb, cash is king" (Dave Ramsey)

---

## 4. Decision Rules

### DR-01: Hero Positioning
IF the copy talks about the brand's backstory, mission, or founding story as the main narrative THEN rewrite. The customer is the hero. The brand is the guide.

### DR-02: Single Desire
IF multiple desires compete for attention THEN choose ONE for this BrandScript. Others go in sub-BrandScripts.

### DR-03: Survival Connection
IF the defined desire doesn't connect to survival (money, time, social networks, status, resources, generosity, meaning) THEN redefine it until it does.

### DR-04: Problem Depth
IF the copy only addresses the external problem THEN add internal (feeling) and philosophical (ought/shouldn't) layers.

### DR-05: Guide Evidence
IF the copy expresses empathy but shows no competency THEN add testimonials, stats, or logos. IF it shows competency but no empathy THEN add "We understand..." statements. Both are required.

### DR-06: Plan Clarity
IF there is no step-by-step plan THEN add a 3-step process plan. IF the customer's barrier is fear (not confusion) THEN also add an agreement plan.

### DR-07: CTA Strength
IF the CTA uses passive language ("learn more," "if you're interested") THEN replace with direct language ("Buy Now," "Schedule a Call"). IF there is no transitional CTA THEN add one (free PDF, webinar, sample).

### DR-08: Stakes Calibration
IF there are zero negative stakes THEN add 3-4 consequences. IF the negativity feels excessive THEN reduce to moderate. "Fear is salt in the recipe."

### DR-09: Success Specificity
IF the success vision is vague ("we help you succeed") THEN make it concrete ("a yard that looks better than your neighbor's").

### DR-10: Grunt Test
IF you cannot answer these three questions within 5 seconds of reading the copy THEN revise:
1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make my life better?
3. What do I need to do to buy it?

### DR-11: Word Count
IF the landing page uses paragraphs above the fold THEN cut to a single statement + CTA. IF any section uses more than 3-4 sentences THEN condense to bullets or add "read more" link. "The fewer words you use, the more likely people will read them."

### DR-12: Repetition
IF a sound bite appears only once THEN repeat it. The controlling idea should appear in the header, repeated as customers scroll, in emails, in ads, in conversation. "People have to hear your message about eight times before they internalize it."

---

---

## 6. Content Type Application

### 6.1 Landing Page / Website

```
HEADER (above fold):
  [Controlling idea / aspirational promise] -- large text
  [Direct CTA button] -- top-right + center, bright color
  [Transitional CTA] -- smaller, next to direct CTA
  [Value stack] -- 3-4 bullet points (optional)
  [Image] -- happy people / aspirational lifestyle

STAKES SECTION:
  [3-4 negative consequences of not buying]
  Brief paragraph or bullet points

VALUE PROPOSITION:
  [Expanded offer -- swing back to positive]
  [Can include testimonial or benefit bullets]

GUIDE SECTION:
  [Empathy + competency]
  [Photo of founder/team optional]
  [3 testimonials or client logos]

PLAN SECTION:
  [3 numbered steps with icons]
  [Each step = one sentence]

EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH:
  [2-3 paragraphs for due diligence readers]
  [Use "read more" link if long]

LEAD GENERATOR:
  [Transitional CTA repeated]
  [Pop-up + in-body]

FOOTER (Junk Drawer):
  [Everything else: about, FAQ, careers, social]
```

**Key rules:**
- Text above fold = short statement, not paragraph
- "Buy Now" button = different/brighter color than all other buttons
- Direct CTA repeated as user scrolls
- People scan websites, they don't read them. "Write it in Morse code."
- Images of success (smiling people) outperform images of buildings/offices
- 10 sentences or fewer on the entire page is ideal

### 6.2 Email -- Nurture Sequence

```
PATTERN: Nurture -> Nurture -> Nurture -> Sales [repeat]

NURTURE EMAIL:
  P1: Talk about a PROBLEM
  P2: Offer a plan/idea/formula that solves it
  P3: Describe life when the problem is solved
  P4: Summarize advice into 3 steps
  PS: One punchy line (often the only part read)
  Footer: Logo, one-liner, phone number

SALES EMAIL:
  P1: Talk about the customer's PROBLEM
  P2: Describe YOUR PRODUCT as the solution
  P3: Describe life after purchase
  P4: Price, discount, strong CTA
  PS: Urgency or scarcity element
```

**Key rules:**
- 20% open rate is industry standard. Don't panic about low opens.
- Even unopened emails brand your name into the customer's consciousness.
- Unsubscribes are good -- they clean your list of non-buyers.
- Use exact sound bites from BrandScript in every email.

### 6.3 The One-Liner (Elevator Pitch)

```
PROBLEM + PRODUCT AS SOLUTION + RESULT

1. State the PROBLEM (the hook):
   "Most small business owners waste money on marketing that doesn't work..."

2. Name the SOLUTION (keep it brief -- just name it):
   "StoryBrand helps you clarify your message..."

3. Describe the RESULT (vision of success):
   "...so customers engage and your business grows."
```

**Key rules:**
- Every team member should memorize and use it
- Test on strangers. If they ask for your card, it's working.
- Use in email signatures, business cards, signage, social bios
- Do NOT ramble about features in the "solution" section

### 6.4 Digital/Social Ads (Short Form)

```
1. Open with PROBLEM or VILLAIN (hook)
2. Position brand as GUIDE (1-2 lines: empathy + competency)
3. State the PLAN (simplified)
4. Paint SUCCESS (specific image)
5. DIRECT CTA

Keep under 100 words. Lead with the problem.
```

### 6.5 Sales Conversations / Scripts

```
1. Identify the customer's PROBLEM (ask, don't assume)
2. Express EMPATHY ("We understand how frustrating that is")
3. Demonstrate COMPETENCY (brief proof)
4. Present your PLAN (3 steps)
5. Paint SUCCESS (what life looks like after)
6. State FAILURE stakes (what happens without action)
7. DIRECT CTA: "Our product will solve your problem. Would you like to place an order now?"
```

### 6.6 Lead Generators (Transitional CTAs)

Five types that work best:
1. **Downloadable guide** (PDF) -- cheapest, easiest, most effective to start
2. **Online course / webinar** -- positions you as expert
3. **Software demo / free trial** -- risk-removal
4. **Free samples** -- "try before you buy"
5. **Live events** -- builds database + community

**Title formula:** Make it irresistible:
- "5 Things Your Website Should Include"
- "5 Mistakes People Make with Their First Million Dollars"
- "Building Your Dream Home: 10 Things to Get Right Before You Build"

### 6.7 Testimonial Collection

Ask these five questions:
1. What was the problem you were having before you discovered our product?
2. What did the frustration feel like as you tried to solve that problem?
3. What was different about our product?
4. Take us to the moment when you realized our product was actually working.
5. Tell us what life looks like now that your problem is solved.

These questions yield a natural transformation arc. Use for written testimonials, video interviews, and case studies.

### 6.8 Referral System

1. Identify existing passionate customers
2. Give them a helpful tool to spread the word (video, PDF, referral link)
3. Offer a reward (discount, commission, free product)
4. Automate the campaign via CRM

---

## 7. Anti-Patterns

These are FAILURE MODES. Any of these will cause the copy to underperform or fail entirely.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| AP-01 | **Brand as hero** | Customer perceives competition, not partnership | Rewrite with customer as hero, brand as guide |
| AP-02 | **Too many words** | Customer burns calories, tunes out | Cut 50% of text. Write in Morse code. |
| AP-03 | **No clear CTA** | Customer doesn't know what to do next | Add bright "Buy Now" button top-right + center |
| AP-04 | **Missing villain** | Problem has no focal point | Define one root-source villain |
| AP-05 | **External-only problems** | Misses the deeper motivator | Add internal (feeling) + philosophical (ought/shouldn't) |
| AP-06 | **No stakes** | No urgency, no reason to buy | Add 3-4 failure consequences |
| AP-07 | **Vague success** | Customer can't envision the destination | Make it concrete and specific |
| AP-08 | **No plan** | Cognitive dissonance blocks purchase | Add 3-step process plan |
| AP-09 | **Passive CTA** | "Learn more" / "If you're interested" | Replace with "Buy Now" / "Schedule a Call" |
| AP-10 | **Brand backstory first** | Nobody cares about your founding story | Lead with customer's desire and problem |
| AP-11 | **Information dump** | Website answers questions nobody asked | Use the 8-section wireframe; put extras in footer |
| AP-12 | **Multiple villains/desires** | Story is unclear, audience confused | One villain, one desire per BrandScript |
| AP-13 | **Guide transforms** | Audience doesn't know who the story is about | Guide is strong and fixed. Only the hero transforms. |
| AP-14 | **No repetition** | Message doesn't stick | Repeat controlling idea 8+ times across channels |

---

## 8. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Customer is the hero. Brand is the guide.** Every sentence must serve the customer's story, not the brand's ego.

2. **If you confuse, you lose.** Clarity over cleverness. Always. "Don't be clever; be clear."

3. **One desire, one villain, one story.** Multiple plots = confusion. Subplots come in separate BrandScripts.

4. **Direct CTA must be bold and obvious.** Different color, repeated on every scroll position, asks a yes/no question.

5. **Address internal problems, not just external.** "Companies sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems."

6. **Fear is salt in the recipe.** Some failure stakes are mandatory. But moderate, not excessive.

7. **Specific beats vague.** "A yard better than your neighbor's" > "a nice yard." "Twenty minutes, twice" > "quick workouts."

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

8. **Express empathy BEFORE competency.** Trust before respect.

9. **Use process plans with 3-6 steps.** Name the plan. It removes cognitive dissonance.

10. **Include both direct AND transitional CTAs.** "Will you marry me?" + "Can we go out again?"

11. **Show images of happy people, not buildings.** Visual proof of closed story loops.

12. **Write in Morse code.** Brief, punchy, relevant. 10 sentences or fewer on a page.

13. **Repeat sound bites identically.** Your campaign is a memorization exercise.

### NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable)

14. **Define an aspirational identity (From -> To).** This creates brand evangelists.

15. **Use the Before/After grid** to map customer transformation across four dimensions.

16. **Create a referral system** with tools, rewards, and automation.

---

## 9. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing, verify ALL twelve:

1. **Grunt Test:** Can a caveman grunt back (a) what you offer, (b) how it helps, (c) what to do to buy? Within 5 seconds?

2. **Hero Check:** Is the customer the hero in every sentence? Is the brand positioned as guide, not hero?

3. **Problem Depth:** Are all three problem levels present -- external, internal, and philosophical?

4. **Empathy + Competency:** Does the guide section have both? (Not just one.)

5. **Plan Exists:** Is there a clear 3-step process? Does it reduce cognitive dissonance?

6. **CTA Clarity:** Is the direct CTA bold, bright, and repeated? Is it a yes/no question, not a vague suggestion?

7. **Stakes Present:** Are 3-4 failure consequences stated? Is the fear moderate (salt, not the whole shaker)?

8. **Success Specificity:** Can the reader picture EXACTLY what life looks like after purchase?

9. **Survival Connection:** Does the core desire connect to financial resources, time, social networks, status, resources, generosity, or meaning?

10. **Word Count:** Could you cut 50% and lose nothing? If yes, cut it.

11. **Controlling Idea:** Is one sentence repeated throughout that captures the entire story? Could a customer say it to a friend?

12. **Sound Bite Consistency:** Are the EXACT same phrases used across the page? No synonyms, no variations. Repetition = memorization.

---
