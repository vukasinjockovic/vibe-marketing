# Brunson Funnel Architecture & Email Sequences

This skill governs HOW you build sales funnels, write email sequences, structure offers, and match traffic to funnel types. It is selected when the campaign involves funnels, email sequences, upsell flows, Value Ladders, or traffic-to-offer matching.

---

## 1. When This Skill Is Active

**On demand.** Activate this skill when the campaign brief mentions any of: sales funnel, email sequence, upsell, downsell, Value Ladder, webinar funnel, product launch, free-plus-shipping, Attractive Character, Soap Opera emails, or Seinfeld emails.

Before writing any funnel copy, email sequence, or offer structure:
1. Identify the **traffic temperature** (hot, warm, cold) from the brief.
2. Identify the **Value Ladder position** (frontend, middle, backend) of the offer.
3. Select the correct **funnel type** from the Funnel Selection Decision Tree (Section 5).
4. Select the correct **script** for that funnel type.
5. Determine the **Attractive Character** identity and storylines to use.
6. If writing emails, determine whether this is a **Soap Opera Sequence** (new subscriber) or **Seinfeld emails** (ongoing).

---

## 2. The Value Ladder

Every business needs a Value Ladder -- a structured sequence of products and services arranged by ascending value and price.

| Level | Price Range | Purpose | Funnel Type |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Bait** | Free / free-plus-shipping | Attract dream customers | Two-Step |
| **Frontend** | $7-$97 | Qualify buyers | Two-Step or SLO |
| **Middle** | $100-$2,000 | Deeper engagement | Webinar, Invisible, Product Launch |
| **Backend** | $3,000-$100,000+ | Maximum value service | High-Ticket Three-Step Application |
| **Continuity** | Recurring monthly | Lifeblood of business | Continuity Funnel |

**Rules:**
- You cannot build an effective funnel without a complete Value Ladder.
- Most businesses have only 1-2 pieces. Add the missing pieces first.
- There is no ceiling: "There's no end to your Value Ladder."
- Every Value Ladder must include a continuity program: "If you don't have continuity, then you don't have a business."

---

## 3. Traffic Temperature

All traffic falls into three temperatures. Each requires different messaging, pre-frame bridges, and sometimes different landing pages.

### 3.1 Hot Traffic
- **Who:** Your email list, podcast listeners, blog readers, existing customers.
- **Communication:** Personality-driven, like talking to friends. Use Seinfeld emails.
- **Pre-frame bridge:** Short -- quick email or blog post with link.
- **Copy approach:** Product-aware. Lead with product name and offer.
- **Funnel position:** Can enter at any level of the Value Ladder.

### 3.2 Warm Traffic
- **Who:** People who don't know you but trust someone who does (JV partners, affiliates).
- **Communication:** Endorsement-based -- borrow credibility from the list owner.
- **Pre-frame bridge:** Moderate -- JV email, endorsement, "lift letter."
- **Copy approach:** Solution-aware. Lead with the desire/solution, then introduce product.
- **Funnel position:** Frontend or middle.

### 3.3 Cold Traffic
- **Who:** Strangers -- Facebook ads, PPC, banner ads, SEO.
- **Communication:** Education-first. Use general language, avoid jargon.
- **Pre-frame bridge:** Longest -- quiz, article, presell page, blog post, bridge page.
- **Copy approach:** Problem-aware. Lead with the problem, then solution, then product.
- **Funnel position:** Frontend only.

> "If your prospect is aware of your product, your headline starts with the product. If he is not aware of your product but only of the desire itself, your headline starts with the desire. If he is not yet aware of what he really seeks but is concerned with the general problem, your headline starts with the problem." -- Gene Schwartz (cited by Brunson)

### 3.4 The Only Goal
Convert ALL traffic into traffic you own (your email list). Traffic you control (paid ads) goes to a squeeze page. Traffic you don't control (organic, social) goes to a blog with squeeze-page functionality at the top.

---

## 4. The Attractive Character

Every funnel needs an Attractive Character (AC) -- a persona that attracts clients, builds following, and drives sales.

### 4.1 Four Elements
1. **Backstory** -- Where the AC came from. Must relate to the product. Without it, the AC is "just a dude eating subs."
2. **Parables** -- Teaching stories from the AC's life. More powerful than facts.
3. **Character Flaws** -- Vulnerabilities that make the AC relatable. "No one wants to hear about the perfect person."
4. **Polarity** -- Take a stand. Split the audience. "Being neutral is boring."

### 4.2 Four Identities (Pick One)
| Identity | When to Use | Story Style |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **The Leader** | AC has already achieved the result | "I've been where you are. Follow me." |
| **The Adventurer** | AC is curious, brings back discoveries | "I went on a journey and brought back treasures." |
| **The Reporter** | AC is new to the niche, interviews experts | "I talked to the best. Here's what they said." |
| **The Reluctant Hero** | AC is humble, feels moral duty to share | "I didn't want the spotlight, but I had to share this." |

### 4.3 Six Storylines
1. **Loss and Redemption** -- "I had everything... then ___ happened... it was a blessing in disguise..."
2. **Us vs. Them** -- Polarize. "Talkers vs. do-ers."
3. **Before and After** -- "First I was ___. Now I'm ___."
4. **Amazing Discovery** -- "Wait til you hear what I just found!"
5. **Secret Telling** -- "I've got a secret... to find out, you need to ___."
6. **Third-Person Testimonial** -- Social proof through others' stories.

---

## 5. Funnel Type Selection

Use this decision tree to select the correct funnel.

```
START: What is the price point?
  |
  v
$0-$97 (Frontend)?
  YES -> Physical product to ship?
           YES -> Two-Step Free-Plus-Shipping Funnel
                  Script: Who/What/Why/How
           NO  -> Price $27-$97?
                    YES -> SLO Funnel
                           Script: Star/Story/Solution (44 steps)
                    NO  -> Continuity Funnel
                           Script: Who/What/Why/How (trial) or Star/Story/Solution (no trial)
  NO -> continue
  |
  v
$100-$2,000 (Middle)?
  YES -> Live or automated presentation?
           LIVE  -> Sales Webinar Funnel | Script: Perfect Webinar
           AUTO  -> Automated Webinar Funnel | Script: Perfect Webinar
         Try-before-you-buy?
           YES -> Invisible Funnel | Script: Magic Bullet + content
         Multi-day launch?
           YES -> Product Launch Funnel | Script: 4-Video sequence
  NO -> continue
  |
  v
$3,000+ (Backend)?
  YES -> High-Ticket Three-Step Application Funnel
         Change selling environment to PHONE
         Script: Setter + Closer two-step phone script
```

---

## 6. Email Sequences

### 6.1 Soap Opera Sequence (New Subscribers -- Auto-responder)

Send immediately after opt-in. Purpose: build rapid bond with the Attractive Character.

| Email | Name | Purpose | Key Element |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Set the Stage | Welcome, set expectations | Open a loop: tease tomorrow |
| 2 | High Drama | Start at peak drama, fill in backstory to the wall | Open new loop: promise answer in #3 |
| 3 | Epiphany | The turning point; tie to product | CTA to product |
| 4 | Hidden Benefits | Unexpected upsides of following this path | Stronger CTA with offer details |
| 5 | Urgency + CTA | Real scarcity, final push | Must be genuine urgency |

**Mechanics:**
- Each email opens a loop and closes the previous one (like a soap opera)
- 1-2 sentences per line, lots of white space
- Personality over perfection
- Every email after #1 includes a CTA

### 6.2 Seinfeld Emails (Ongoing -- Daily Broadcasts)

After Soap Opera Sequence completes. Purpose: maintain relationship + sell daily.

**Formula:** 90% entertainment + 10% content. Every email tells a personal story and ties it back to a product with a CTA.

**Topics:** Daily life, embarrassing moments, opinions, purchases, kid/pet antics, funny memories, vacation plans, holiday stories, rage-turned-humor.

**Critical Rule:** "EVERY EMAIL and each story must be tied back into some type of offer. If you just send out entertaining emails and don't tie in your products, you won't make a dime."

**Frequency:** Daily. "If I don't email my list every day, I lose money every day."

- Each slide: "So you're getting ___ AND ___ AND ___."
- Show final Stack Slide with complete offer
- State total value
- If/All statements: "If all this did was ___, would it be worth it?"
- Reveal actual price (much lower than stacked value)

### 7.6 Funnel #6: Product Launch

**Position:** Middle | **Price:** $100-$2,000 | **Traffic:** Warm/hot (email lists)

**Structure:** 4 videos released over several days.

2. Application form (prospect sells YOU on why they deserve a slot)
3. Homework page: 3 videos (teaching, personal story, testimonials) + phone instructions

**Phone Script: Two-Person (Setter + Closer)**

**Setter's Job:**
- Introduce in low-key way, have natural conversation
- Find prospect's emotional hot buttons (hopes, dreams, the WHY behind the goal)
- Identify the wall: "What's holding you back?" (always some form of "I don't know how")
- Pivot: "If you knew how to ___ in 5 hours a week, would you do it?"
- Give a taste of the program (not details -- that's what they're buying)
- Get prospect to sell himself: "Why would working with [AC] help you succeed?"
- Probe: collect financial info, credit, savings, goals
- Get 4 commitments: time, coachability, start today, invest (OPM concept)
- Hand off to closer with positioning: "He's the expert. Not everyone is accepted."
- Give homework: write down goals + 3 things wanted besides money

**Closer's Job:**
- Re-confirm goals, emotions, timeline (6mo, 12mo, 5yr)
- Connect prospect's dreams to working with AC
- Re-get 4 commitments: time, decision-making, resources, teachability
- List what's included in the program
- Final close: "Why do you feel you'd be a good candidate?"
- Take payment -- prospect is asking YOU to let them buy

---

## 8. The OTO Script (Universal Upsell)

Used after ANY frontend purchase across all funnel types.

**Structure Rules:**
- Rule #1: Do NOT sell more of the same thing (itch is scratched)
- Rule #2: Do NOT sell a random unrelated product
- Choose one: "The Next Thing" / "Do It Faster" / "Need Help?"

**Script (3-5 minute video, works up to $2,000):**
1. **Confirm Initial Decision** -- "Your order is not yet complete." (NEVER say "your order is complete" -- it closes the loop)
2. **Smart -> Why** -- "You've made a smart choice, and here's why..."
3. **3x 2x Question** -- "How would you like to get ___ results in ___ time?"
4. **Exclusive** -- "This is NOT for everyone. Only because you proved you're an action taker."
5. **Results, Fast, Speed** -- "This will help you get results in half the time."
6. **The One Thing** -- Focus on ONE key feature (not everything)
7. **Future Pacing** -- "Can you imagine your life when you have ___?"
8. **CTA** -- "Click the button below right now."
9. **Guarantee** -- Reverse risk
10. **Value Stacking** -- Bonuses (pull out the most desired item, offer as "free" bonus)
11. **Scarcity** -- "Only available right here, right now. When you leave, it's gone."
12. **Second CTA**
13. **Testimonial Rush** -- Multiple testimonials

---

## 9. The Epiphany Bridge

A story structure used throughout funnels and emails where the AC describes the moment they discovered the solution:

1. Start at the point of high drama
2. Go back and fill in the backstory (how you got into the mess -- where the reader is now)
3. Hit the wall (stuck, just like the reader)
4. The Epiphany -- the "ah-ha" moment that changed everything
5. First sign of success
6. Rapid growth after the realization

The Epiphany Bridge connects the reader's current pain to the product by showing them a relatable journey from problem to solution. Used in Soap Opera Email #2-3, Star/Story/Solution steps 6-15, and webinar content sections.

---

## 10. Decision Rules (Numbered)

**DR-01:** IF traffic is cold THEN use problem-aware language and a long pre-frame bridge (quiz, article, presell page) before the landing page. IF warm THEN use solution-aware language with JV endorsement. IF hot THEN use product-aware language with direct links.

**DR-02:** IF frontend offer ($0-$97) THEN use Two-Step or SLO Funnel with short scripts. IF middle ($100-$2K) THEN use Webinar, Invisible, or Product Launch with longer scripts. IF backend ($3K+) THEN use High-Ticket Application and change selling environment to phone.

**DR-03:** IF subscriber is new THEN send 5-email Soap Opera Sequence (auto-responder). IF subscriber has completed Soap Opera THEN switch to daily Seinfeld emails (broadcasts).

**DR-04:** IF upselling after purchase THEN offer "The Next Thing" (what they need next to reach their goal) OR "Do It Faster" (tool that speeds results) OR "Need Help?" (higher-ticket coaching). NEVER sell more of the same. NEVER sell something unrelated.

**DR-05:** IF you can create a physical free product THEN prefer free-plus-shipping (8x more buyers). IF numbers don't work THEN try straight sale or trial.

**DR-06:** IF product price exceeds $2,000 THEN change selling environment from online to phone, direct mail, or live event.

**DR-07:** IF on OTO page THEN keep the sales loop open. Say "Your order is not yet complete" -- NEVER "Your order is complete."

**DR-08:** IF building a webinar THEN identify 3 false beliefs that prevent purchase and create a Secret to break/rebuild each one.

**DR-09:** IF reverse-engineering competitors THEN you need at least 4 of 5 variables: demographics, offer, landing page, traffic source, ad copy. NEVER proceed with 2 unknowns.

**DR-10:** IF building any funnel THEN add an order form bump ($37 product, checkbox after credit card info, before submit). ~34% take rate with zero friction.

---

## 11. Pre-Writing Checklist

Complete ALL steps before writing any funnel copy or email sequence.

- [ ] **Step 1 -- Identify Traffic Temperature:** Is this for hot, warm, or cold traffic?
- [ ] **Step 2 -- Identify Value Ladder Position:** Frontend, middle, or backend?
- [ ] **Step 3 -- Select Funnel Type:** Use the decision tree in Section 5.
- [ ] **Step 4 -- Select Script:** Match the script to the funnel type.
- [ ] **Step 5 -- Define the Attractive Character:** Which identity? What backstory? What flaws? What polarizing stance?
- [ ] **Step 6 -- Define the One Thing:** The single core promise/benefit that everything points to.
- [ ] **Step 7 -- Identify False Beliefs:** What does the prospect believe that prevents purchase? (For webinars: create 3 Secrets to break/rebuild these beliefs.)
- [ ] **Step 8 -- Map the Offer Structure:** Core product + order form bump + OTO(s). What is "The Next Thing" for the upsell?
- [ ] **Step 9 -- Define Urgency:** What is the real, legitimate reason to buy NOW?
- [ ] **Step 10 -- Plan Email Follow-up:** Soap Opera Sequence for new subscribers. Seinfeld emails for ongoing. Segmented sequences for webinar behavior.

## 12. Anti-Patterns

These are failure modes. Violate any and the funnel dies.

| # | Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| AP-01 | **No Value Ladder** | Single product, nowhere for customers to ascend. Cannot build an effective funnel. |
| AP-02 | **Same pre-frame for all traffic** | Hot, warm, and cold traffic sent to same page with same messaging. Cold traffic bounces. |
| AP-03 | **Cold traffic hears jargon** | "Traffic" and "lists" mean nothing to cold traffic. Use "people" and "visitors" instead. |
| AP-04 | **Upselling more of the same** | Customer already scratched that itch. Offer the NEXT thing, not MORE of the same thing. |
| AP-05 | **Random, unrelated upsells** | No logical connection to frontend = killed conversions. |
| AP-06 | **Closing the sales loop on OTO page** | "Your order is complete" shuts down the buying brain. Keep the loop open. |
| AP-07 | **Content emails without CTA** | Entertainment that never ties to a product = zero revenue. |
| AP-08 | **Fake urgency** | Destroys credibility. Urgency must be real (limited stock, expiring offer, countdown). |
| AP-09 | **Selling high-ticket online only** | Products over $2K need a changed selling environment (phone, event, direct mail). |
| AP-10 | **Founder as phone closer** | "Too close to the outcome emotionally, and it's just bad positioning." Use setter + closer. |
| AP-11 | **No continuity program** | "If you don't have continuity, then you don't have a business." |
| AP-12 | **Boring, neutral AC** | No polarity = no fans = no sales. Take a stand. |
| AP-13 | **Waiting to qualify buyers** | Offer a purchase immediately after opt-in. "Don't wait a day or a week." |
| AP-14 | **Two unknowns in campaign** | Never launch when missing 2+ of: demographics, offer, landing page, traffic source, ad copy. |
| AP-15 | **Skipping reverse engineering** | Building funnels without studying successful competitors. Model what works first. |

---

## 13. Writing Rules (Ranked)

### MUST-FOLLOW (Non-negotiable)

1. **Every email must tie to a product or CTA.** No exceptions. Entertainment without offers = $0.

2. **Match copy language to traffic temperature.** Problem-aware for cold. Solution-aware for warm. Product-aware for hot.

3. **Start stories at the point of high drama.** Never chronologically from the beginning. Hook first, backstory second.

4. **Keep the sales loop open on OTO pages.** "Your order is not yet complete" -- never "complete."

5. **Use the Attractive Character in all copy.** Backstory, parables, flaws, polarity. The AC is what makes people buy.

6. **One Thing per piece.** Each email, each sales letter, each webinar focuses on ONE dominant promise. Not three. Not five. One.

7. **The Stack on every webinar close.** Build the offer progressively. The last thing shown is the FULL offer, not the last bonus.

### SHOULD-FOLLOW (Strong recommendations)

8. **Add an order form bump to every order form.** $37 product, checkbox, ~34% take rate. Minimal effort, maximum revenue lift.

9. **Use free-plus-shipping as default frontend.** 8x more buyers than paid offers. "The power of free."

10. **Email daily after Soap Opera Sequence.** "If I don't email my list every day, I lose money every day."

11. **Segment email sequences by behavior.** Webinar attendees, early leavers, and no-shows get different follow-up.

12. **Reverse engineer competitors before building.** Buy their products. Map their funnels. Know all 5 variables.

13. **Use parables, not facts.** Stories stick. Facts fade. "When you stop teaching facts and start teaching through parables, your messages will stay with an audience longer."

### NICE-TO-HAVE (When applicable)

14. **Copy-paste Seinfeld emails to blog.** Double duty content.

15. **Create an introduction video for speaking.** Control the pre-frame. Don't leave it to the event host.

16. **Use the Invisible Funnel for goodwill.** 85% attendance, 90% pay, plus backend applications.

---

## 14. Post-Writing Quality Checks

After writing any funnel copy or email sequence, verify ALL of these:

1. **Traffic Match:** Does the copy language match the traffic temperature? Would a cold prospect understand every term used?

2. **Value Ladder Alignment:** Does this offer sit at the correct level? Is there a clear path UP the ladder from here?

3. **AC Presence:** Is the Attractive Character present with backstory, parables, flaws, and/or polarity? Or is this generic, personality-free copy?

4. **One Thing Test:** Can you state the single dominant promise in one sentence? Does every paragraph support it?

5. **CTA in Every Email:** Does every email, without exception, tie back to a product or offer?

6. **Loop Mechanics:** In Soap Opera Sequences, does each email open a loop that pulls to the next? Does each close the previous loop?

7. **OTO Structure:** Is the upsell "The Next Thing," "Do It Faster," or "Need Help?" (Not more of the same. Not random.)

8. **Urgency Authenticity:** Is the urgency real? Could a skeptic verify it? Fake urgency destroys everything.

9. **The Stack Check:** On webinar closes, did you build the offer progressively? Is the final slide a complete stack? Did you use If/All statements before the price reveal?

10. **Pre-Frame Bridge:** For cold traffic, is there a bridge page (quiz, article, presell) BEFORE the landing page? Or are you sending cold traffic directly to a sales page?

---
