# Implementation Report: Cialdini Influence Skill
Generated: 2026-02-10

## Task
Create the `mbook-cialdini-influence` SKILL.md from the completed extraction at `/var/www/vibe-marketing/ebook-analysis/cialdini-influence/extraction.md`, matching the quality and operational style of the Schwartz awareness skill.

## Implementation

### File Created
- `/var/www/vibe-marketing/.claude/skills/mbook-cialdini-influence/SKILL.md` -- 524 lines

### Sections
1. **When Active** -- On-demand activation rules, 5-step activation sequence
2. **The 7 Principles** -- Reference table, detailed descriptions, mechanism summary table
3. **Decision Rules** -- 16 numbered rules covering all 7 principles plus stacking
4. **Pre-Writing Checklist** -- 8-item checklist before writing persuasive copy
5. **Principle Selection Decision Tree** -- ASCII flowchart for barrier-based principle selection
6. **The Contrast Principle** -- Standalone amplifier section
7. **Principle-Specific Techniques** -- 7 subsections (one per principle) with tables and copy patterns
8. **Stacking Principles** -- Why stack, 5 proven patterns, 5 stacking rules, format-specific limits table
9. **Anti-Patterns** -- 10 failure modes with fixes
10. **Writing Rules (Ranked)** -- 15 rules in 3 tiers (MUST/SHOULD/NICE-TO-HAVE)
11. **Post-Writing Quality Checks** -- 10 verification items
12. **Key Quotes** -- 15 calibration quotes with context annotations

### Design Decisions
- Every section answers "What does the agent DO?" -- no theory without action
- Included concrete copy examples (Big Mistake good/bad examples, Waiter Vincent model, rejection-then-retreat pricing)
- Added format-specific stacking limits table so the agent knows how many principles to use per format
- Added mechanism summary table (Section 2.3) so the agent understands WHY each principle works
- Matched Schwartz skill patterns: decision trees, ranked rules, anti-patterns with fixes, checklists
- Kept ethical guardrails prominent: Cialdini test, fabrication warnings, authenticity requirements

## Notes
- The extraction contained 15 concrete examples (EX-01 through EX-15). Rather than listing them all, key examples were woven into the operational techniques where they illustrate a specific pattern the agent should follow.
- The extraction's ethical rules (AI-03) were distributed across Writing Rules and Anti-Patterns rather than kept in a separate section, so they appear at the point of use.
