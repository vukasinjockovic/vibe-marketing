## Notes

- The extraction prioritizes operational instructions (what an agent can DO) over book summary
- Every formula and template preserves exact phrasing from the source
- Decision trees in Section 9 synthesize the scattered decision rules into executable flowcharts
- The variation hierarchy (Chapter 16) is critical for the agent's ongoing offer management -- it tells the agent what to change first when performance drops
- Jason Fladlien is the most-cited external expert; his guarantee scripts and data points are the strongest evidence for guarantee ROI
- The "11 Bonus Bullets" framework is the most detailed operational checklist in the book -- it tells the agent exactly how to present each bonus
